    taking_root_2 = """Taking Root one point two. Gordon had one arm, while Lillian was dividing her focus between supporting my other arm, keeping us moving and trying to examine me.  It made for some uncomfortable stumbling and fumbling around, including some grazing touches of the burns, but I didn’t want her to stop doing any of it.  I bit my tongue and inside cheek and endured it, blinking my eyes to try to generate the tears I needed to clear my vision.  I was mostly effective.
    
    Jamie was waiting outside, his book under one arm, our shoes and boots in the other hand.  All the laces had been tied together, making for only one knot that he had to hold to carry them all.
    
    The bundle dropped from his fingers and landed in a puddle.  I spotted my left shoe, on its side in the puddle.
    
    “You’re hurt!” Jamie said.
    
    “You just got my shoe wet,” I said.  I started to point, then winced as skin pulled where the enzymes had eaten away a spot on my arm.  I held back a cry of pain.  My arms had taken the brunt of it.  There wasn’t a spot on the back of my arms where I could have laid a hand flat without touching something the enzymes had devoured.  Some of the burns eclipsed my hands in size, and my arms weren’t large.  My skin looked like a sock that was as much holes as it was fabric, and the flesh beneath was angry, a scalded red, with blood seeping out from crevices.
    
    More burns on a similar scale speckled my neck, one cheek, my side, my legs, and one foot.  My clothes had absorbed the worst of it, elsewhere, only droplets reaching through.
    
    “I saw through the window, but I didn’t realize how bad it was,” Jamie said.  “I thought you all had everything in hand, but then Sy fell, and I wasn’t sure if I should go for help-”
    
    “My shoe,” I commented, managing to point this time around.  Fixating on one thing made it easier to handle the pain.  The wounds themselves didn’t hurt, but the edges burned like fire.
    
    “Sy didn’t fall.  He took a fall.  Wording,” Gordon said.
    
    Jamie’s expression switched from confusion to an accusing glance.  Thinking that Gordon might be wrong didn’t even cross his mind.
    
    “Why?” Jamie asked.  “You got yourself badly hurt, you twit.”
    
    “Did I?” I tried to exaggerate the surprise in my voice, and all the pain-relief chemicals that my body was dosing me with made me sound even more exaggerated, my voice almost breaking.  I added some sarcasm for good measure, “Oh.  I hadn’t noticed.  Thank you.”
    
    Lillian spoke up, “It’s nothing too dangerous.  I don’t like some of these spots on your side, but I don’t think you’re going to die from it.  Not soon.”
    
    “Not soon.  That’s the best we can hope for,” I said.
    
    Jamie looked closer at one of the wounds.  With Gordon still supporting me and both Jamie and Lillian fussing, there were a few more accidental touches of the burns.  One of the touches didn’t actually hurt so much, but I played it up, flinching and letting a gasp out, if only to get them to stop.
    
    “Don’t let him distract you,” Gordon said.  “He’s trying to dodge the ‘why’ question.”
    
    “I’m trying to hurry this along,” I said.  “Priorities.  Can I get medical attention?  Pretty please?”
    
    “Still dodging the question,” Gordon observed.
    
    “Let’s go,” I said.  “Wait.  Jamie needs to pick up my shoe, which is getting soaked through, then we can go.  Maybe since Jamie won’t stop touching me to make sure I’m okay, Jamie and Lillian can make sure I walk okay?”
    
    Gordon looked me over, suspicious.  “You’ll tell us on the way, then?”
    
    “Assuming there’s something to tell,” I said.  I felt the burning at my wrist get worse, and my little noise of pain wasn’t intentional.  I reached for my wrist, and Lillian slapped my hand away like I was a kid going for the cookie jar.  For her benefit, I said, “Hurts.”
    
    “Good,” she said, sounding like a cross between the bossy older sister and a schoolteacher.  “Maybe you won’t do that again.”
    
    She wiped at my arm, clearing away blood where it had welled out from the center of the burn.  Where the blood had run through the edges of the scar, the trickle had left a faint pink line.  Spreading the enzyme around.
    
    “Sy,” Gordon said.
    
    “Gordon,” I cut him off.
    
    There was a pause.  I hesitated to call it tension.  He wanted me to come to my senses, I wanted to wait long enough for his concern for my well being to override his curiosity, which was bound to happen sooner or later.  Tension implied something being stretched to a limit, but we were both being patient.
    
    I felt the burning sensation at my side getting worse.  From a six to a seven on the scale, and I was the one who caved, in the end.
    
    “I promise I’ll tell you after,” I said.
    
    He seemed to consider, rolling his head to one side, then the other.
    
    “Fine.  Jamie, take over?” Gordon said.  “Seems to want you for some reason.”
    
    “Jamie is shorter, I don’t have to stand on my tip toes while he’s holding me up,” I explained.
    
    Gordon transferred his hold on me to Jamie, who had to transfer his hold on his book to the other arm.
    
    “And he’s nicer,” I added.  Jamie rolled his eyes.
    
    “Did you lock the windows?” Gordon asked, ignoring me.  The question was aimed at Helen, who had emerged from the door behind us.
    
    I turned my head to see Helen’s nod.  She and Gordon worked to slide the door closed.  The movement of the wheel through the rut spat water at our legs.
    
    “Let’s hope it stays put,” Gordon said.
    
    “I thought we decided that it wouldn’t go anywhere after eating,” Lillian said.  “Carnivore eating habits.  Hunt or scavenge, eat, rest, rouse, repeat.”
    
    “It was hungry enough to eat two meals.  Probably going through a final growth spurt,” I said.  “Let’s not rule anything out.”
    
    “Okay,” Lillian said, right beside me, and I was genuinely surprised at the note of anxiety in her voice, how it had cut the word short.  “We can leave now.”
    
    Very nearly but not a question.  A plea?
    
    I suspected it was fear, but that suspicion sat askew in my head.  Lillian had experience with that stuff.  She’d had hands on experience with creatures and experiments at the Academy.  More restrained than that one had been, but the idea of the unrestrained experiment wasn’t enough to justify the thought.  It was probably well fed enough that it would ignore any meal that didn’t walk right into its open mouth.
    
    Or lay there struggling as the snake charmer had.
    
    There we are, I thought.  The snake charmer.  I could remember Lillian shielding her eyes.  The anxiety had more to do with the reminder of the man and the way he’d left this world.  If he had left it.  There was a chance he was still in there, alive and slowly dissolving.
    
    Gordon had collected the bundle of shoes but hadn’t handed them out.  Which was fine.  My feet were muddy, and I had a burn on the top of my foot that would have made wearing the shoes hard.  The burn announced its presence every time I stepped in a puddle.
    
    It wasn’t a particularly short walk back, and I was content to keep my mouth shut.  If I started talking, I might have started grunting or making noises in response to the pain.  If I started whimpering, then Gordon might have started reminding me that I’d done this to myself.
    
    Instead, I focused on the future.  The snake charmer had been handled.  Were questions possible?  What about my injuries?
    
    “We’re close to King,” Jamie said, interrupting my thoughts.  I realized Helen and Gordon were talking, with Gordon doing the lion’s share.  I’d tuned it out.
    
    “Yeah,” I noted.
    
    “Busy street means head down,” Jamie said, very patient.  He tugged on the front of my hood, so it could shroud my face in shadow.  “Hood down.  We don’t want your face to scare the locals any more than usual.”
    
    I couldn’t help but smile wide at that.
    
    The main street was framed on both sides by taller buildings, a great many of them being apartments.  People sat on steps beneath the overhang of their porches, smoking, and the occasional light glowed from within rooms above.
    
    The plant growth that supported the structures reached overhead to meet and mesh.  An arch, to introduce us to the main street proper.  King Street.  It was a thick crowd, even in the late afternoon, the sun setting.  Men and women in raincoats, with umbrellas, walking on either side of the road.
    
    Lillian and Jamie stopped supporting me quite so much.  I started to teeter over a bit, and Jamie caught me at roughly the same point I stuck a leg out to catch my balance myself.  I hadn’t realized how heavily I’d been leaning on the others, or how dizzy I felt.
    
    Horses pulling coaches outnumbered cars at a nine to one ratio.  Of those horses drawing coaches, only one in five were truly alive.  The remainder were stitched, their hides patchwork, seams joined by thick black thread or by metal staples with burns where they touched flesh.  Were I able to see beneath the heavy raincoats, I would have seen the thick metal bolts that had been screwed into points down their spines.
    
    Live horses were an affectation, really.  There was a convenience to them, as they didn’t suffer from the water in this city where it always rained, they could be taken out hunting, and they had personalities.  A horse could be a member of one’s family.  There was a lot to like.
    
    But the stitched horses, voltaic horses if you asked someone who knew what they were talking about, they were cheap, they didn’t get tired, and rather than food, they could be kept going by connecting wires to the bolts on their backs and waiting.  When a stitched horse had done its work for the day, it could be placed in what amounted to a long closet.
    
    There were no rules for the road, but everyone found their way.  Most people here knew most others.  A lack of courtesy today could be paid by a lack of cooperation from others tomorrow.  That wasn’t to say there weren’t idiots or disagreeable types who others paid no mind to, but it largely worked.
    
    Like the branches and plant growth, it amounted to a planned chaos.  The exact shape and character of branches couldn’t be decided in advance, but the key elements were given attention, the problematic ones pruned.  The squat apartment buildings didn’t have room for even stitched horses, which meant every essential service had been put within walking distance.  Pubs, grocers, tailors, barbers and the like.
    
    I raised my eyes.  Looking down the length of King, I could see it rise at a gradual incline, until it touched the perimeter of the Academy itself.  Radham Academy, to be specific.  All things flowed from it, all things flowed to it.  I imagined the same went for any Academy.  Stick one somewhere, and people would collect to it like flies to a carcass.  The advances and work that went hand in hand with an Academy would bleed out in a very similar way.  First to the city as a whole, then to surrounding regions.
    
    Jamie grabbed the tip of my hood and tugged down, forcing me to look at the ground in front of me.  I’d been showing too much of my face.
    
    We moved as a huddle, and with our heads down and hoods up, we weren’t much different from half of the streets’ occupants.  My burns didn’t earn me a second glance, because I scarcely warranted a first one.  I suspected that Gordon had chosen where he stood with the idea of shielding me from others’ sight, for added assurance.
    
    I liked the thought.  It made me wonder if any other people in the crowd were in similar straits.
    
    Ahead of us, a large shape loomed.  It looked like the offspring of a deer or rabbit might, if their offspring was squeezed out too early.  No larger than one of the cars on the street, it was pink, with stretched skin, the translucent eyelids appearing bruised with how they let some of the darkness of the black eyeballs beneath leak through.  Its head sat crooked, forcing it to see the way forward with only one of its two wide set eyes.  Its mouth hung open.
    
    Most prominent, however, were the legs.  Not much thicker around than my leg, half again as long as the tallest man on the sidewalk was tall, the four legs ended in points, a single claw to each leg.  Saddlebags were strapped to saddlebags to form chains that draped the thing like a peculiar sort of jewelry.
    
    As the coaches and cars on the road made way and cooperated, so did the people on the sidewalk.  This however, was motivated by discomfort and fear.  Men and women gave the thing almost the entire sidewalk to itself.
    
    A woman led it on a fine chain, holding an umbrella overhead, though the creature’s mass already helped shelter her from the rain.  She was barely entering into her twilight years, but only the pale color of her once-blonde hair suggested as much.  Her face and body were young, and her clothes looked expensive, though they tended toward the simple.
    
    I very nearly tipped over again, as Jamie let go of me and stepped forward to obscure the woman’s view of me.
    
    Feeling as wobbly as I did was more than a little concerning, and a delay was the last thing I wanted.
    
    “Hello Mrs. Thetford,” Helen greeted the woman, smiling.
    
    “Helen,” Mrs. Thetford said, tugging on the chain to make her packbeast stop in its tracks.  Her expression changed from an easy smile to shock.  “Look at you!  You look like something the cat dragged in!”
    
    How apt, I thought.
    
    “It’s Sylvester’s fault,” Helen said.  “He pushed me and I got wet.”
    
    Of course she invents a lie that makes me look bad.  I made a point of hanging my head, to better conceal my injuries.  I could see the crowd passing around and to either side of us.
    
    “Sylvester, for shame,” Mrs. Thetford said, and she used my name as a rebuke, and the way she said ‘shame’ even made me feel a bit abashed over the deed I hadn’t committed.  “You really should be nicer to girls.”
    
    “He really should,” Helen said, and her tone was perfect.  Just a little bit smug, chiding, but not so much of either that Mrs. Thetford would think less of her.
    
    “And you,” Mrs. Thetford said, reaching under Helen’s hood to comb Helen’s hair back with long fingernails.  “You should give some thought to keeping better company.  I know you’re loyal to your so-called brothers and sisters, but you could do so well if you devoted some time to others.  Your caregivers have very nearly polished you into a diamond, and it would warm my heart to see you finish the transformation.”
    
    “Thank you, Ma’am,” Helen said, smiling, pretending to be a little shy.  Not a lot, but enough to be humble.  “It means a lot that you think so well of me.”
    
    “If you decide that you would like to become more of a lady, I would be more than happy to introduce you to some people who could teach you the finer points.  Music, dancing, etiquette.  The same goes for you, Gordon.  You’re evidence that Helen here isn’t a simple fluke.  It would take more doing, but I think we could turn you into a proper gentleman with some tutoring.”
    
    “I might take you up on that offer, ma’am,” Gordon said.
    
    “Do!  You should,” the older woman said.  She brushed Helen’s cheek with her fingers.  “You’re a dear.  I would have you for myself, if I hadn’t already had my fill of raising children.”
    
    “For now, if it’s alright, I’ll have to content myself with getting home before it’s dark.  I’m looking forward to getting dry again,” Helen said, sticking me with a look.
    
    “Of course!  Now I feel bad for keeping you.  You know where to find me if you would like those lessons.”
    
    We hurried on.  Rather than take the long route around to the sides, we passed under and between the legs of the packbeast that was carrying Mrs. Thetford’s shopping.
    
    By the time we’d flowed back into the crowd, almost invisible, Helen’s expression had gone flat again, her eyes cold.  The smile was gone.
    
    She saw me looking.
    
    “Are you upset?” she asked.
    
    “Why would I be upset?”
    
    “I blamed you.”
    
    “I always get blamed.  I’m used to it.”
    
    She seemed to take that at face value.
    
    I might have pursued conversation, but it would have been purely for self gratification, and I was feeling less and less like talking.  My brain had apparently decided that the easiest way to handle what I was feeling was to declare that all of me hurt, and certain parts of me hurt enough that I was reconsidering my ‘one to ten’ scale of pain.  If I focused on any one part of me too much, it quickened.
    
    All of that in mind, I was very glad to see the orphanage.
    
    The building was perched in an odd spot, beside a creek and a stone bridge that was thick with grown-in vegetation. The land by the riverbed was stony, uneven, and threatened to be damp, discouraging building efforts, but the building itself had been here long before the Academy, serving as a home for shepherds when Radham had only been a few buildings set around a crossroads.
    
    That it had withstood the test of time was either pure luck, or the person who had mortared the stones together had known what they were doing.
    
    One floor tall, with a stone exterior, it lacked the reinforcing growths that marked so many nearby structures.  The only wood came from a tree in the backyard.  A short stone wall encircled the property, only three feet tall, and the height both served as a way of keeping the smallest children on the property and was paradoxically welcoming.  I couldn’t approach it without wanting to hop up onto it.
    
    Toward the back of the property, I could see that Ralph Stein was in the process of walking the top of the wall.  The route went from the right side of the gate, over to the right of the house, alongside the riverbank, around the back of the house, under the tricky bit where the tree’s branches hung over, up the left side of the house, and then over to the left side of the gate.  All on the weather-rounded, uneven stones that made up the wall’s top, virtually always in the rain.
    
    My focus wasn’t on that.
    
    My focus was on the black coach parked to the left of the house, beneath the overhang in the roof.  The horses were wearing black raincoats, utterly still.  Their driver stood beside them, smoking.
    
    My eye didn’t leave them as we made our way down the steps that had been set into the slope.  Each one of the stone stairs had seen enough traffic and years that they’d been reshaped, as if buckling faintly under thousands of footfalls.
    
    Gordon pushed open the door.  Lillian and Jamie helped me through.
    
    We stopped in our tracks at the sight of a man in the front hallway.
    
    If it had a brain and a nervous system, the parts could be used for making a stitch, or voltaic creature.  The quality of that stitched was indicated by the placement of the stitches that gave them their name.  Poorer work or a stitched that had been ‘repaired’ often involved joins in visible or inconvenient places.  Across the face, or across the joints, where they interfered with function.  A good stitch had the joins and scars kept just out of sight, under the chin, or in places where clothes could cover the work.
    
    The figure that stood guard by the door was the most human-like stitched I’d ever seen.  Tall, broad-shouldered, the parts had been selected for size and raw power.  But for stitches visible just past the cuffs of his jacket, I might not have known.  He wore a suit under a hooded raincoat and carried a pistol at his hip.
    
    He was, in two short words, a problem.
    
    I smelled tea, and I heard very little commotion.  If I hadn’t seen the coach outside, I could have put two and two together to figure out that we had a guest.
    
    “That would be the children,” Mrs. Earles said.
    
    The others properly put away hoods, cloaks, shoes and boots before toweling their feet to a reasonable state of clean and dry.  Lillian bent down and had me lift up my feet one by one to dry them.
    
    “Thank you,” I murmured.
    
    “It’s what I’m here for,” she murmured back.
    
    One by one, we headed around the corner from the front hall, into the sitting room.  The room itself had homey touches, and was very much Mrs. Earles.  It was her perch in the evenings, the part she made her home.  The knick-knacks and decorative carvings, still, were placed well out of reach of errant hands, on the mantlepiece above the blazing fireplace and on various shelves and bookshelves.
    
    My eyes scanned the shelves and bookshelves.  Searching.
    
    Mrs. Earles didn’t give off the image of someone who ran an orphanage.  She’d struck me more as the assistant to that sort of someone.  Managing one child had a way of turning women into mothers, wearing away at certain things while exaggerating others.  Even with help, managing sixteen should have pushed her to an extreme in some respect.  Something in the vein of a tyrant or a defeated woman, a woman who turned to vice to escape stresses, or a saint.  But she wasn’t any of those things.
    
    A part of me wanted to think of her as a mother, but she wasn’t.  She didn’t pretend to be.  She ran Lambsbridge, she kept us fed and sheltered, and she was quick to use the threat of a smack to keep us in line.  Even though I’d been a recipient more than once, I could appreciate that she didn’t hesitate in that respect.  I had to live with fifteen others, and if they were allowed to run rampant, I faced more grief than I did dealing with the occasional rap to the knuckles.
    
    Mr. Hayle, by that same token, was almost but not quite my father.
    
    He frowned as he saw me, immediately taking in details that more than a hundred people in the busier part of the city had failed to spot.
    
    “I’ll make sure you don’t have eavesdroppers,” Mrs. Earles said, disappearing.
    
    “Thank you,” Mr. Hayle said, without turning to look at her.
    
    We stood in the entry to the sitting room, while he examined each of us, silent.
    
    He was an older man.  Sixty or so, as far as anyone’s age could be pinned down with certainty.  He hadn’t prettied himself up or taken advantage of Radham Academy’s resources to remove wrinkles or revitalize his hair.  His hair was grey and waxed back away from his face, and his wrinkles cut so deep into his face that I could have imagined them as cross-hatching done with a scalpel.  He wore a doctor’s coat indoors, the fabric thick, dyed black so that it wouldn’t show any blood stains.  His gloves had been pulled off, and the ends were sticking out of one pocket.  A collection of files were already tucked under one arm.
    
    “The other children are accounted for.  I’ll be in the kitchen, where I can intercept anyone coming your way,” Mrs. Earles said.
    
    “Thank you,” he said.
    
    She retreated, leaving us alone.
    
    “I was planning on a longer meeting,” Mr. Hayle said.  “To look at Sylvester, he might not be able to stand for the duration.  Is he stable?”
    
    “I’m stable,” I said, at the same time Lillian said, “He is.”
    
    Mr. Hayle frowned.  “What happened to you?  No.  Hold off on that.  If you’re stable, let’s cover the essentials.  Tell me, how was it?”
    
    Gordon answered.  “Our target’s second experiment is in one of the warehouses, off to the southeast of King.  Sleeping off a meal, we’re hoping.  It’s there, with all of the notes.  As for the target, he’s…”
    
    “In his experiment,” I said, managing a smile.
    
    Mr. Hayle didn’t smile back.  “I don’t understand.  Clarify?”
    
    “Dead,” Gordon said.  “Swallowed.”
    
    “Complications?”
    
    We collectively uttered a chorus of ‘nos’ and shook our heads.  I glanced at the back of Jamie’s head, saw the faintest hesitation before he joined us in shaking his head.
    
    “What happened to Sylvester?”
    
    “The snake charm- ah, our target, he arrived, forcing us to hide.  He found me in my hiding spot, purely by chance, and took me hostage.  Sylvester distracted him, and was splashed with-”
    
    “Enzymes,” I said.
    
    “Splashed with enzymes, during the altercation that followed.”
    
    “I did what I could,” Lillian said, “Neutralized the spread with counteragents our target had on hand.”
    
    Mr. Hayle nodded.  “Good.  Lillian, I believe this marks your third assignment with the group?”
    
    “Yes, sir.”
    
    “Would you do another?”
    
    I didn’t miss the hesitation on Lillian’s part.
    
    I tried to view things through her eyes.  Seeing the man get swallowed.  The horror.
    
    “I would, sir,” she decided.
    
    “Good.  You’ll continue to have my support at the Academy, then.  If you don’t find all doors are open and all resources available to you, let me know.  Your tuition will continue to be waived.”
    
    “Thank you sir.”
    
    “That takes care of the, ah, what did you call him?  The snake charmer?  Now, unless there’s anything else, I should look after Sylvester there.”
    
    There was a jumble of ‘no sir’s from the others.
    
    He crossed the room, and the others were quick to get out of his way.  I used the opportunity to move to one side, further into the sitting room, and scanned the shelves.
    
    There.
    
    Mrs. Earles didn’t keep matches close to the fireplace, and she didn’t keep them where the smaller children could get them.
    
    Even for me, it would require that I stand on my toes and reach high overhead.
    
    The problems that came with being small.
    
    Mr. Hayle was talking while he found and put on his boots.  “I do want to have a longer discussion.  I’ll need to rearrange my evening, which will take me at least an hour.  Add the time it takes to deliver Sylvester… hm, it would be late.  Too late?”
    
    “The younger children will be in bed.  I could ask Mrs. Earles,” Gordon said.
    
    “No.  I’ll be by in the morning.  I only considered tonight because I thought you’d want to know how Sylvester was.  I can send someone your way, if you’re willing to keep an eye out the window for them.  A quiet, short visit to pass on word.”
    
    “Please, sir,” Gordon said, sounding far more solemn than I’d have expected.
    
    “I’ll see to it.  Thank you for another job well done.  Sylvester?”
    
    I was out of time.
    
    With a wall between myself and Mr. Hayle, each of the others positioned to see, I reached up to the shelf, and felt my burns stretch, eliciting a tearing sensation, and a fresh renewal of pain.
    
    I closed my fingers around the matchbook, then collapsed against the wall, panting.
    
    “Problem?”
    
    “Moved too fast,” I said.
    
    Mr. Hayle gave me a sincere look of concern as he did up the buttons of his coat and took his umbrella from his stitched bodyguard.
    
    “Let’s get you looked after,” he said.  He paused.  “No shoes?”
    
    “Burn on my foot,” I said.
    
    “Carry on, then.”
    
    I discovered that stopping and then moving again was quite possibly the worst thing I could have done.  Every burn felt fresh.  The movement of my arm was the worst of it.  The stitched bodyguard helped me, even going so far as to lift me bodily to my seat.  All the same, by the time we reached the coach, I was sweating bullets from pain alone.
    
    The coach’s interior was red, the windows stained to reduce the light that came in, and something that looked like a glowing orange minnow swam in a bowl overhead, casting light on the interior.
    
    The driver steered the stitched horses around.  Before long, we were on King Street, heading for the Academy.
    
    “It’s rare that I have a chance to talk with one of you,” Mr. Hayle said.  “Can I see your arm?”
    
    I offered it.  He probed the edges of the injury.
    
    “I suspect you’ll resist, out of loyalty to your… brothers and sisters?  Is that how you think of them?”
    
    “Friends.  Gang,” I said.  I swallowed hard.  “Sometimes I think of them as siblings.  What am I resisting?”
    
    “Giving me information.  Can you tell me if they’re doing alright?”
    
    “Yes,” I said.  “They’re doing everything they’re supposed to do.”
    
    “Is that so?  Something tells me you wouldn’t tell me if they weren’t.”
    
    I smiled a little.  “What makes you think that?”
    
    “I’ve watched you grow up these past few years.  I’d like to think I know you.”
    
    I nodded.  I forbade myself from looking outside the window.
    
    “Not up to talking?”
    
    “Not sure what to say, sir.”
    
    “Tell me about the snake charmer.”
    
    “Yes sir.  Um-”
    
    A crash shook the coach.
    
    I could hear shouts.  Mr. Hayle’s coach came to an awkward stop, lurching, then jerking to the left before finally going still.
    
    He twisted in his seat, and slid a panel to one side.  “John?”
    
    There was a pause.  The driver replied, “Water.  Knocked me off my seat.  One of the voltaic horses got drenched.  It’s gone quiet.”
    
    “Water?”  Mr. Hayle asked.  He frowned.  “I’ll be right out.”
    
    I remained where I was, very much in pain after the sudden movements.
    
    “Douglas,” Mr. Hayle said.  “Look after Sylvester.  Be ready to come outside at a moment’s notice.”
    
    “I understand,” Douglas said, the words clumsy in a way that was hard to define.  Too precise, the local accent rounded off at the edges.  I suspected it would be worse if it was a more unfamiliar phrase.
    
    The door of the coach closed.
    
    One, two, three.
    
    I forced myself to sit up.
    
    I opened my eyes.
    
    Naturally, going outside, Mr. Hayle hadn’t taken his paperwork.
    
    When problem solving, the simplest answer shouldn’t be discounted.
    
    I reached for the files.
    
    The bodyguard reached out, blocking my hand with his.
    
    “That is not yours,” he said.  The words were clumsier than his ‘I understand.’
    
    If it was a human bodyguard, and not one that had died and been reanimated, rendered very simple and loyal in operation, I suspected I could have manipulated him or sent him out of the coach.
    
    Stitched were easier in some ways, harder in others.
    
    I pulled the matches out of my pocket.
    
    I struck it.
    
    He didn’t flinch.
    
    I blinked.
    
    Reduced to very primal, simple function, they were supposed to have reactions to fire.  Nine times out of ten, it was fear.  One time out of ten, it was violent and destructive rage.
    
    The quality of this stitched was top notch.  Had Mr. Hayle or the person he bought the stitched from somehow solved the problem?
    
    “Put that out,” the stitched told me.
    
    I reached out, bringing the match closer to him.
    
    He didn’t move.
    
    “Put that out,” he said, more firmly.
    
    I moved my hand, and he remained where he was.
    
    No, the problem hadn’t been fixed.  But they’d found a step forward.
    
    He was frozen.
    
    I’d hoped to distract and disturb him enough that he’d forget his instructions and let me snatch up the files.  This, however, worked.  Still holding the match up, the whole of his attention focused on it, I grabbed the stack of folders.
    
    I returned to my seat.
    
    Before I could open the folders, the door opened.
    
    Mr. Hayle studied me, his expression blank.
    
    I froze, caught red handed.  Well, the red hand was the burn, but-
    
    “And it all makes sense,” he said.
    
    “Yes,” I said.
    
    “Sylvester,” he said, climbing up into the coach and taking his seat, “You know why I made you.”
    
    “Yes sir.”
    
    “Each of you.  My colleagues in other departments have made weapons, monsters, they’ve made viruses and more, with the understanding that there may very well be a need for these weapons.”
    
    “Yes sir,” I said.
    
    “My focus, as you very well know, is on,” he reached over, and he tapped me on the forehead.  “The brain.”
    
    “And I was dumb just now,” I said.  “Failed project?”
    
    “No,” he said.  “No.  I made you.  Like I said, I know you.”
    
    “If it helps, I’m starting to believe you, sir.”
    
    “It would be stupid of me to make you for a purpose and not expect you to fulfill that purpose.  Mistakes here and there are to be expected, and your mistake here was expecting me to be dumb.  You’re still developing, and each of you are still being refined in your own ways.”
    
    I nodded.
    
    “Why didn’t you ask for the files?” he asked me.
    
    “Because you might have said no, and you would have known I wanted them,” I said.  “And because I think people are more genuine when you catch them off balance.”
    
    He nodded.
    
    “Something to keep in mind,” he said.  “And I suppose I’m getting too predictable, if you were able to arrange this.”
    
    “Yes sir,” I said.
    
    “Take a look,” he said.
    
    For a telling second, I thought the files would be empty, that he might have checkmated me.
    
    But I paged through them, and I found them filled with pages of data, notes, design, and more.
    
    Helen, project Galatea.
    
    Jamie, project Caterpillar.
    
    Gordon, project Griffon.
    
    Sylvester, project Wyvern
    
    I found the fourth file.  The one I’d wanted.
    
    I glanced over the first page, then closed it, nodding.
    
    “Why?” Mr. Hayle asked.  “All that for a glance?”
    
    “Yes sir.”
    
    “What, specifically?”
    
    “Expiration dates, sir.”"""
    
    taking_root.append(taking_root_2)
    
    taking_root_3 = """Taking Root one point three. The syringe was fancy, glass with silver leaf at the ends and at the plunger.  The glass had turned smoky where it had once been clear, and only the faintest trace of the original contents were still inside.  Thicker around than any three of my fingers put together.  It probably cost twenty dollars, if not more.  A good week’s wages.
    
    Somewhat vindictively, I pulled out the plunger until I had the weight balanced, put my fingers on it, and sent it spinning wildly on the desk, periodically rustling scattered papers or sending them floating over the desk’s surface, riding a thin layer of air.  Traveling across the desk, it struck an identical syringe, eliciting a pair of high, sweet songs from the ringing glass.
    
    It didn’t break.  Shame.
    
    I stepped over to the window, my feet kicking up more papers as they might stir leaves in the fall.  I was at ‘the Hedge’, the colloquial term for the wall that encircled the Academy.  A great deal of the wall wasn’t large or tall at all, but it rose in places, and the corner of the Academy closest to Radham had a hospital built into it.  Through the hospital, students bought their turns at getting training and locals bought care.  The view was of the wall itself, the Academy on one side, Radham on the other.
    
    About the only thing that was the same about the two places was that it was raining.  A light rain, but enough that just about everyone had their hoods up.  The boys and girls on the Academy side moved as though they were all in a hurry.  They were all tidy, hair well looked after, white uniforms clean.  Their bookbags had flaps over the top to keep the rain out, and the buckles that kept the flaps in place each had the university’s symbol on it, a full-face helmet in profile framed by red leaves and ribbons.
    
    Almost but not quite a badge of office.
    
    Outside, watched from a distance, people moved as though they were mired in tar.  They found their way eventually, but there was no clear direction, even in a city that had been built with a plan in mind.
    
    I didn’t enjoy looking, but there wasn’t much else to be done.  I’d read the books, I’d read the various papers, and I’d slept.  Seven days I’d been cooped up here.
    
    I felt a chill, and rubbed my hands over my bare arms.  My skin had been replaced where the enzyme solution had devoured it, and while the pigmentation was very slightly different if I looked for it, it remained sensitive, not yet used to heat and cold, to the rubbing where seams of clothing touched it, or to idle scratches.  I kept my shirt off, but that meant being colder, and though it was dawn and spring had sprung, it was gloomy outside.
    
    I held the back of my hand up to the edges of the window, letting the sensitive skin feel the movements of the air.  Slowly, so as not to disturb the air with my own movements, I moved my hand along the point where the window glass met the frame.
    
    I felt the point where the breeze came through as though ice had touched the new skin.  Pulling my hand away, I tore the end off one page of paper and popped the paper into my mouth before setting the syringe to spinning at full speed once again.
    
    The syringe rattled as I got the motion wrong, and the rattle prompted the papers under the cot to rustle.  Not because I’d moved or because I was going anywhere.
    
    Periodically, someone came to talk to me.  I was already figuring out their schedules.  Going by the time of day and the schedules I’d observed over the past week, they were past due to arrive.
    
    Being past due meant they were up to something.  I was tense, chewing on the little bit of paper, listening past the patter of the rain on the window and the sound of the syringe spinning on the desktop.
    
    I could hear the murmur of speech, too far away and muted to make out.
    
    I recognized Mr. Hayle’s voice.
    
    “-Or worse than before?” I could make out the tail end of the sentence.
    
    “More or less the same, professor.  But as intractable as he gets, his behavior differs from month to month.  This time, he wanted to be alone.  Very much so.”
    
    “I wonder if it has something to do with the fact that it followed so quickly off the back of another incident, or the pain he was experiencing.  Make a note.  If we’re bringing another student on board to oversee the Wyvern file, that would be a good way to bring them up to speed while doing something constructive.”
    
    “Yes, professor.”
    
    There was a pause, pronounced, then a knock on the door.
    
    “Sylvester?”
    
    I didn’t respond right away.  Reaching up to my mouth, I pulled the wad of paper out, then jammed it up against the gap in the window where it was leaking cold air.
    
    “I’m here,” I said.
    
    The door opened.  It only opened a few inches before it hit the toppled bookcase that barred the way.  The rest of the floor was carpeted in scattered papers, fallen books, and various folders.
    
    I angled my head to one side, and saw Mr. Hayle do the same, peering through the gap.  He looked at me first, then the bookcase.
    
    “How are you?” he asked.
    
    “My head hurts,” I said.  It did.  It hurt in a very different way than my body had.  My body had been effectively burned by the enzymes, and burns hurt more than just about anything.  My brain, however, it felt like it had been poked, prodded, beaten and kicked into the dirt, then made to do a marathon after the fact.  The burn only hurt the parts that were burned.  This was the sort of pain that made everything hurt, and promised more pain every step of the way for the rest of the journey.
    
    A hollow, empty, tired hurt.
    
    “I can well imagine.  How in the world did you pull over the shelf?”
    
    What he was asking was how a boy who weighed four point seven stone could pull over a floor-to-ceiling solid wood bookcase with half the books still on it.  Mr. Hayle might not have been able to knock it down in the prime of his youth.
    
    “I pushed the upper corner,” I said.  “Then I dropped a book into the gap so it couldn’t go rock back to where it was.  Pushed again, dropped more books in.  Kept at it, and eventually it tipped.”
    
    “You scared the wits out of some of my colleagues.  They thought a part of the roof had fallen in.”
    
    “We thought something had escaped,” a woman’s voice in the hallway said.  “It was like someone had kicked an ants nest, people scurrying around to find out what had gone wrong.”
    
    I couldn’t resist smiling a little at that.
    
    Hayle smiled, though only half was visible through the gap in the door.  “Ah, there we go.  Your expression was so cold I thought we’d somehow lost you, Sylvester.  I don’t suppose you could think up a way to lift the shelf back into place?”
    
    “Probably,” I said.  “I could get started soon.  It would take a while.”
    
    “I was hoping to have you out of there sooner than later,” he said.
    
    “Why?” I asked, without missing a beat.  I knew I sounded hostile, cold as he’d put it.  I didn’t care.
    
    “Your… the Lambsbridge gang has asked for you.  I myself would appreciate your help.”
    
    My eyebrows went up.
    
    “I might see if Douglas here can-”
    
    “Why?” I cut him off.
    
    “Excuse me?”
    
    “Why do they need my help?”
    
    “That, Sylvester, is a question I’m more than happy to answer, but I don’t feel like detailing it all through a door.”
    
    I frowned, reaching up to scratch my head, looking around.
    
    Hopping up onto the back of the bookcase, I approached the door, examining the frame and the door itself.
    
    “As I was saying,” he said.  “I could ask Douglas to try pushing on the door-”
    
    I seized one of the syringes, paused to set the other one to spinning, just for the heck of it, and headed over to the cot.
    
    “-he should be strong enough to move the bookshelf, don’t you think, Lacey?”
    
    “I think so, professor,” the woman on the other side said.
    
    “Now that I think about it, my concern is damaging the door.”
    
    “It should be okay, I think.”
    
    “Okay, Douglas, come here…”
    
    When I glanced up, Mr. Hayle wasn’t looking through the gap.  It was probably awkward to keep in that position, right up against the door.
    
    I put my bare shoulder under the bottom of the cot, using my whole body to lift it up.  The metal of the cot’s frame was cold against my back.  I set the syringe on the floor and slipped to one side to let the cot drop.  The leg came down to break the glass.
    
    The noise made something under the bed move, flying out to the corner by the door and bookcase.
    
    “Stop, Douglas.  Sylvester,” Mr. Hayle said.  “What was that?”
    
    “Allow me one minute,” I said, absently, picking my way past the pieces of glass.
    
    “I’m sure Douglas could get you out.  I’m not sure what you’re doing there, but if we could minimize the damage and the explanations I have to give my colleagues that are working here in the Hedge, I would appreciate it.”
    
    “Damage is done,” I said.  If only to the syringe.  I shifted my position, lifted up the cot again, and repositioned the plunger-end of the syringe.  “I’ll be fifty seconds.”
    
    I imagined him repressing a sigh.  All I heard, however, was a, “very well.”
    
    A doctor using a syringe had to put their fingers into two metal loops just by the plunger.  My target was the loop.  I moved out of the way, and let the leg of the cot fall.
    
    I twisted and worked the loop until the metal gave way, then raised the cot again.
    
    Using my hands, I folded the broken bit of metal in two, for a long length of metal.  I collected a fallen medical text, and it was heavy enough I could barely hold it in one hand.
    
    Placing the long bit of metal on the underside of the hinge, pointing up, I gave it a solid whack with the book.
    
    The pin that held the hinge together popped up.
    
    Another whack made it pop out.
    
    The other hinge was high up enough that I had to stand on my toes to reach it, even with the bookcase under me.
    
    I gave it the same treatment, and the pin came free.
    
    “Okay,” I said, swiftly backing up, “Done.  Push.”
    
    I very nearly stepped on the glass from the syringe, before arresting my movement.  My leg and bare foot stayed up, and I caught my balance, tipping over, twisting, and then throwing myself at the desk with the still-spinning syringe on it, just to have something to grab.
    
    Around that same moment, someone pushed on the door.  Without the hinges, it simply tipped forward and fell onto the back of the bookcase.
    
    Mr. Hayle was there, wearing his uniform, including the black lab coat with a hood, and I spotted the red headed woman in the white lab coat, who I knew only as Lacey.  Shapely, thirty or so, and wholly dedicated to her work.  Unfortunately.  I suspected the first-name-only was supposed to endear her to me, but it really didn’t.
    
    “I’m glad you’re okay, Sy,” she said, her voice soft.  Trying too hard to be gentle.
    
    Mr. Hayle picked his way past the door, stepping onto the back of the bookcase, apparently intent on surveying the damage.
    
    “Sir,” Lacey said, suddenly sounding concerned rather than gentle.
    
    He turned.
    
    “There were two glass cases in the room.  They were inhabited.”
    
    Mr. Hayle froze.
    
    “The snake and spiders?” I asked.  “They’re around here somewhere.  Something was under the bed.  It’s pretty close to you.”
    
    “They don’t concern you?” Mr. Hayle asked.
    
    I shook my head, then wished I hadn’t.  It made the general kicked-into-the-dirt pain in my head come back.
    
    “I won’t come any further then.  If you’d find a shirt and come out?”
    
    I nodded.  I collected my shirt from the bed and pulled it on.
    
    All things considered, he seemed remarkably at ease over the damage I’d done.  I wondered who the office belonged to.
    
    “Walk with me,” he said.  “Douglas, please listen to Lacey as she instructs you about putting the shelf back in place and catching the smaller animals.  Lacey?  Bring him to my office in the tower when you’re done.”
    
    “Yes sir,” Lacey said.
    
    She reached for me while I passed, and I jerked my shoulder to strike her hand away rather than let it rest on me in anything resembling reassurance.
    
    Mr. Hayle hadn’t missed it.
    
    I buttoned up my shirt while we walked.  I was wrinkled, my hair greasy and sticking out at the ends.  I might have looked feral.
    
    “You don’t like her.”
    
    “No.”
    
    “I could tell you she’s a lovely, vibrant young lady, but that’s not the question, is it?”
    
    “No.”
    
    “I didn’t think so.  Let it be what it is, then.  Tell me, honestly, do you feel up to working?”
    
    “I’m rarely honest,” I said.
    
    “Then give me a convincing lie.”
    
    “Yes, sir.  If they need my help, I’ll give it.”
    
    He frowned a little.
    
    “What’s going on?” I asked.
    
    “The night I dropped you off, I gave them a task.  It is perhaps the most important job that the Lambsbridge project has been given.  One only your particular group can do.”
    
    He’d had my attention.  Now he had my curiosity.
    
    He probably knew me better than I was willing to admit, if he was getting to me this quickly.
    
    That, or my defenses were down, and I was giving him more clues than I’d intended.
    
    “I positioned them at the Mothmont ladder school to investigate a problem, and they’ve run into a block.  No forward progress.”
    
    “If I’d known I’d be going to school I don’t think I would have helped you move the door.”
    
    “Then let me tell you why you opened the door.  Three weeks ago, a student at Mothmont killed his father, then himself.  The victim was a Crown State Senator.  Autopsies didn’t indicate any particular chemicals or abnormalities.  Nine days ago, we had another incident.”
    
    “Another Mothmont student.”
    
    “Yes,” he said.  He paused as we passed a pair of students in grey lab coats.  Graduates.  The red and silver of the Radham Academy crests they wore on their breasts were stark against the muted fabric.
    
    “Hello, professor,” the girl of the pair greeted Mr. Hayle.
    
    “Good morning, Heather, good morning, Daniel,” he replied.  We continued walking.  When they were out of earshot, he resumed his explanation.  “A house burned with four individuals inside.  Charred bodies of a lawyer, his wife, and his politician brother were autopsied, and trauma suggests they were cut with the intent of disabling, limiting their movements so they couldn’t escape the fire.  Ankles, knees.  The daughter of the lawyer was found in a separate room, a Mothmont student herself, but the cuts were different.  A day later, there was a third incident.  The day I appeared at Lambsbridge to talk to you.”
    
    “Three makes a pattern.”
    
    “The third incident saw the son murdering his father, grandfather, and mother, the father and grandfather were, again, prominent.  Military.  He set fire to the crime scene and sat in the midst of it to burn up.”
    
    “Method?”
    
    “Beg pardon?”
    
    “What was the murder weapon?  Do they know?”
    
    “The father and grandfather were killed with a sword that had hung over the mantlepiece, both were in their beds.  The mortician believes the mother fled and tried to fight back.  She had defensive wounds  and a weapon of her own in hand.  She lost the fight.”
    
    She lost.  That was interesting unto itself.
    
    “You’re sending us after killer children,” I observed.
    
    “I would call them assassins rather than killers.  You understand the concern here?”
    
    We’d reached the end of the hallway.  Mr. Hayle opened a closet and retrieved my cloak and shoes from within.  I started pulling my outdoor clothes on.  “It doesn’t look good.”
    
    “No, Sylvester, it doesn’t.  Mothmont was made and supported by rich and powerful individuals with the premise that younger students would graduate from there and move on to the Academy.  If they couldn’t pass the entrance exam, they would continue their studies at Mothmont until they could.  Only the best in teachers, facilities, and students.”
    
    “Except for the parent murdering part,” I noted.
    
    We began our way down.  There were more students in the stairwell, four men clustered at one window, smoking, two women sitting on the stairs below.  Both scooted over as we came down.
    
    One of the women smiled at me as I descended.  Twenty and beautiful and wearing a white lab coat that suggested she was still a student.  Almost an older Helen without the Helen-ness.  When I met her gaze, my expression flat, her smile dropped off her face.
    
    Mr. Hayle spoke in a low voice, his head turned to make sure nobody above us was listening in as we continued down the spiral stairs.  “Being different tends to draw attention, whether it’s being inferior or being superior.  Mothmont, being superior, has clearly fallen under someone’s eye.  We would like this to stay out of the public’s eye.  The only reason it hasn’t, I believe, is that the third incident happened halfway across the country.  Given a fourth incident or time for rumors to spread…”
    
    “…The cat would be out of the bag.  I get it.”
    
    “This isn’t quite like any of the tasks I’ve given the Lambsbridge project, but it’s one I feel you’re suited for.  That said, it is sensitive, Sylvester.  Lives are on the line, the people who know and are paying attention matter, and the reactions if others found out could be disastrous.”
    
    “I get it,” I said, again.  I knew I was more irritable.  I had the information I’d wanted, and now I was finding myself slipping back to the point I’d been: feeling the ache in my head and resenting everything for existing.
    
    “Each major department was given a share of funds to go toward major projects.  Rather than devote my funds into one project, I devoted them to six very different projects.  The plan was for the six to form a whole.”
    
    I nodded.
    
    “It’s unfortunate that only four of you proved viable, but you’ve turned out well, you each show more and more promise as you develop, but you remain one member of a unit.  A gestalt.  Your group is feeling your absence, and they feel it strongly enough that they went out of their way to ask for you.”
    
    “I’m touched,” I said.  I wasn’t lying about that, but my thoughts were more on the fact that I’d get to rub it in their faces.  They needed me.  I could be smug about it.
    
    We reached the first floor.  He held the door for me, and we passed through, heading straight for an office.
    
    The grey-coat doctor that had given me fresh skin greeted us, exchanging brief pleasantries with Mr. Hayle before getting down to brass tacks.  I shouldn’t spend too long in the sun until a few weeks had passed.  Never mind that the sun rarely showed its face around these parts.
    
    My thoughts were already on the situation at Mothmont.  I was a week behind the others, and time was already proving to be of the essence.
    
    ☙
    
    It wasn’t Mr. Hayle that dropped me off, but his student Lacey.  One of three students assigned to me.  It made for a very quiet, uncomfortable ride to Mothmont.  I did my utmost to make it uncomfortable for her, glaring at her.
    
    To her credit, she seemed to have difficulty meeting my eyes.
    
    “Professor Hayle suggested I take you to get your hair cut,” Lacey said, summoning some courage and meeting my gaze.  “So you’re more presentable.”
    
    “It isn’t long.”
    
    “It’s long enough to get untidy very easily,” she said.  “It wouldn’t take long.”
    
    “No,” I said.
    
    “Sy-“
    
    “No,” I said, again.  “Don’t suggest it again.  There’s a reason I want my hair like it is.”
    
    “I’m sorry,” she said, raising her hands.  “I understand.  How about food?  You barely ate at all after you locked yourself in the office.”
    
    “I ate plenty,” I said, meeting her eyes.  “You didn’t find all the spiders that had been in the glass case, did you?”
    
    She was stricken with a paralyzing sort of alarm at the idea.
    
    She seemed to shake it off, and she managed a titter of a laugh. “You’re messing with me.”
    
    I looked out the window, and very casually remarked, “It’s sort of disgusting when a woman as old as you are tries to giggle and act like a little girl.”
    
    I didn’t look at her to see her reaction.  That would have taken away from the effect.  My peripheral vision suggested she’d reacted as if I’d slapped her full-on in the face.
    
    “Don’t talk to me like we’re friends,” I said, still not looking at her.  “I’m your job.”
    
    “You seem to have civil conversations with professor Hayle, Sy- Sylvester.”  She’d switched to the long form of my name at the last second.
    
    “Yeah,” I said.  I met her eyes.  “I respect him, if nothing else.”
    
    Three students had hands-on roles with the Wyvern project.  With me.  I had no idea how many were peripherally involved.  Looking at Lacey, one of the three students, I couldn’t see any trace of a smile on her face.  The look in her eyes was a mixture of dislike and pity.
    
    Pity.  And she wondered why I hated her as much as I did?
    
    “I see,” Lacey said.  “Understood.  Can I ask-“
    
    I tensed a little, leaning forward with my hands on my knees, and I heard the hitch of hesitation in her voice.  A momentary pause.
    
    “-Why now?” she finished.  “I won’t say there haven’t been incidents in the past, but why are you suddenly taking issue with me today?”
    
    “You can ask,” I said, and I left the statement hanging.
    
    She turned her head, looking out the window I’d been staring out of a moment ago.  Apparently she wasn’t too surprised at the non-answer.
    
    “Every day for the last week, you knocked on the door, you tried to talk to me, to reassure, to offer food, sheets or clothes.”
    
    “And you wanted to be left alone?” she asked.
    
    “I did, but that wasn’t it.  Give a man a gun, tell him to shoot his neighbor or he gets shot.  The first man we put in this situation does it without a care.  He pulls the trigger.  The second man cries and moans, he begs his neighbor for forgiveness, then he pulls the trigger.  The third man cries and moans, begs for forgiveness, and pulls the trigger, and the fourth man takes a bullet because he won’t bring himself to do that.”
    
    “The second and third men are the same?”
    
    “Oh.  Right.  The first and second man went home and went to sleep and rested easy,” I said.
    
    She worked through it aloud, summing up, “First shoots without a word, sleeps easy.  Second man asks for forgiveness, shoots, sleeps easy.  Third man asks for forgiveness, shoots, but doesn’t sleep.  The fourth dies because he won’t shoot.  You’re going to tell me the first man is the best of the four?” Lacey asked me.
    
    I gave her a disgusted look.  “No.”
    
    “The third, then.  You’re implying I’m the second?  It’s a pretty massive, incorrect assumption on your part, Sylvester, if you think I sleep easy,” she said, and there was a touch of heat in her voice.  I’d upset her a little.
    
    “No,” I said, calm.  “I didn’t say anything about someone being better or worse.  They can face the situation any way they want to.  They’ve got a gun to their head, it’s their choice.  You?  Maybe you’re like the second man, maybe you’re like the third, but you definitely don’t have a gun to your head.  If you’re being nice to me, it’s for your benefit, not mine.”
    
    I leaned back, turning away from her, my attention returning to the window.
    
    Human nature.  If I’d simply said it, one line, one sentence, she wouldn’t have listened.  But I’d gotten her thinking, pulled her in, and then forced her to face it.
    
    The remainder of the coach ride to Mothmont was blissfully silent.
    
    Mothmont turned out to be an interesting building.  Four stories with a steep, slanted shingle roof, it took up a third of a city block, it had no yard that I could make out.  The walls were eggshell pale, and the ivy that crawled across the brickwork was dark, almost leafless.  It wasn’t in an end of town I’d frequented, but even among nicer buildings with gargoyles that spat out water from the gutters and built-in stables for stitched horses, it stood out as something prominent.
    
    A woman was waiting for me by the arching entrance that led into the building.
    
    Lacey didn’t say a word as I left the coach, pulling my hood up to shield off the rain.
    
    “Sylvester, I take it?” the woman asked.  She was buxom, the word was, businesslike in a pink jacket and short dress, brown hair curled at the sides, with a touch too much makeup.
    
    “Yes ma’am.”
    
    “You have manners.  Good.  I’m the headmistress.  Let’s have a look at you.”
    
    I pulled down my hood.
    
    Somehow she didn’t look particularly pleased.  I was a little scruffy.
    
    “Come, inside,” she said, guiding me with a hand at my back.
    
    She led me in past the front office, pointing me to the boy’s bathroom.
    
    “Uniform on the chair by the sink.  Take a moment to wash your face before getting dressed.  I’ll bring you a comb so you can tidy your hair.”
    
    I nodded, and I did as she asked.
    
    The uniform turned out to be white.  White slacks and a button-up shirt with short sleeves and a straight, stiff-necked collar.  The white of it was likely a nod to the Academy.
    
    I hated white.  I’d seen too much of it, and it didn’t suit.  My hair was black, and even with grease or glue or whatever else I put into it, the ends would curl up and it would find a way to break loose.
    
    I made myself as presentable as possible, knowing it wouldn’t last.
    
    I stepped out of the bathroom and presented myself to the headmistress.  She knelt before me and smoothed out some of the clothing, picking at one piece of lint.
    
    “It suits you,” she lied.  “You look like a young gentleman.”
    
    Two lies in two breaths, straight to my face.  I almost liked her.
    
    “It’s lunch time.  You can introduce yourself to the others.  The afternoon classes are all dedicated to biology.  On Fridays, we visit the Academy.  Now, a boy named Jamie was staying at the orphanage.  Do you know him?”
    
    “Yes, ma’am.”
    
    “You’ll be in the same classes as him, and you’ll sleep in the same quarters.  You should find him sitting under the tree in the yard, I think.”
    
    “I’m not surprised.”
    
    “This is strictly temporary, you understand?” she asked.  “I don’t want you to get your hopes up.”
    
    “I understand, ma’am,” I said.
    
    She straightened, looking down at me.  “Mrs. Earles believes you might be motivated to try harder, seeing what we have to offer.”
    
    “I think I will, ma’am,” I said.
    
    “Go on, then,” she said.
    
    I went.  A woman stood by a gate, opening it to let me through.
    
    The building formed a square, with the yard in the center, the precious pupils safe within.  A glass was erected with trees grown to support it at the corners, keeping those beneath dry.  The glass roof itself crawled with vines and small flowers.
    
    Youths aged seven to fifteen were gathered within, many playing, or gathered in groups.  Blankets were laid out here and there for them to sit on, so they wouldn’t get their uniforms dirty.
    
    Just as the students of the Academy had possessed a refined, polished air, these students looked proper.
    
    It didn’t take me long to find the others.  Gordon was in the company of the boys, a larger group.  Helen was among the girls.  Jamie was under one of the trees at the perimeter, book and pen in his lap.  He’d seen me before I saw him, and was on his feet in a moment.
    
    Lillian, I found off to one side, with an obese girl and a taller, skinny, buck-toothed man who looked to be about fifteen.  Gordon whistled, sharp, and got her attention.  She quickly said her goodbye to her two friends.
    
    We collected.
    
    Gordon took one look at me, and I saw genuine worry in his eyes.  “You had an appointment.”
    
    I nodded.
    
    “I’m sorry,” he said.  “We’re supposed to be there for each other when it counts.”
    
    “You didn’t know it was coming.  I didn’t either,” I said.  “At least I don’t have to worry about it for another thirty days.”
    
    He looked unimpressed.
    
    “You’re intolerable after an appointment,” Jamie said.
    
    “I’ll try to be intolerable in a useful way,” I answered.  “Let’s get down to it.  I heard you got stuck.”
    
    “Wait, before any of that, did you come alone?” Gordon asked.
    
    I frowned.  “I got dropped off by Lacey.”
    
    “Damn,” he said.
    
    “We’d hoped Hayle would come too,” Jamie said.  “I thought he’d be more concerned at our lack of progress.”
    
    I looked between the two, confused.
    
    Gordon frowned.  “Look, we’re more than stuck, Sy.  We’re in danger.”
    
    “Danger?”
    
    “They know who we are.  They’re onto us,” Helen said, and her voice was soft and entirely unconcerned.  That wasn’t to say there wasn’t cause for concern.  It was just Helen.
    
    “Five attempts on our lives in the last seven days,” Jamie said.  “And the way we figure it, that means they’re either very, very clever…”
    
    “Or rogue elements from the Academy,” I said.
    
    Jamie nodded.
    
    “Talk to us,” Gordon said.  “Let’s hear your ideas, fresh eyes, before we start giving you reason for bias.”
    
    “Alright,” I said.  “Knowing what little I do, I don’t think the kids are killers.  I don’t think they’re assassins, either.  They’re tools.”
    
    Gordon nodded.  The others were still.
    
    “The killings are steadily improving in quality.  That suggests the kids are the weapons, and the killer is out there,” I said.  “and I think you know that already.”
    
    “We do,” Gordon said.
    
    “What you don’t know, and why I think you’re stuck, is that you’re too prone to patterns.  You have your own way of doing things, but it’s too rigid, when your enemies are hiding in the shadows.  You need to shake it up.”
    
    “You have an idea how, I imagine.”
    
    I smiled.
    
    The pain in my head was going away by the second."""
    
    taking_root.append(taking_root_3)
    
    taking_root_4 = """Taking Root one point four. Our conversation had to stop for a moment when a group of boys veered our way, kicking a ball between them.  They circled the tree that was holding up one corner of the glass roof, then headed off toward their makeshift goals.
    
    “The lunch hour is going to end before too long,” Jamie said.  “We should hammer out details.”
    
    “Sy’s idea, making sure we’re all on the same page…” Gordon said.  “Okay, that makes sense.  Sy?”
    
    “Hold on.  I can change details based on where you guys are at.  Fill me in, quick.”
    
    “Okay.  As far as everyone here knows, including the headmistress and the rest of the faculty, I’m the son of a butcher mogul, Helen is the daughter of a diplomat, and Jamie is the orphan son of a military captain who died and left him some money.  At Jamie’s suggestion, the story is that we were all staying at the orphanage as a matter of convenience before our enrollment at Mothmont.  Favors were called in, whatever.  It’s happened before, given the ties between Lambsbridge and Radham Academy, and it’s not going to surprise anyone.”
    
    “I’ve been here before,” Lillian said.  “Before I was a student at the Academy.  Teachers know me, they like me.  We leaked the idea that I was suspended, and the rules of Mothmont mean I can come back here whenever, to get some classes in, use facilities or brush up.  I might have to explain to my parents, but I think it’s okay.  Nobody’s asked how I know you guys, but I don’t think it’s a problem.”
    
    “I suggested the ‘ties to the orphanage’ thing because I recognized faces among the students, and those faces have probably seen us out and about as a group,” Jamie said.
    
    “Overall, we have a cover,” Gordon elaborated, “Nothing so questionable that anyone’s going to raise questions.  But people have a way of taking things at face value, and this situation hasn’t really bucked the trend.”
    
    “Except for the attempts on your life,” I said.
    
    “Except for that.  But there aren’t any holes in what we’re saying that should have raised suspicions,” Gordon said.
    
    I nodded.  “Mr. Hayle filled me in on most of that, but it’s good to have the details.  He said he was intentionally vague about who I was, so I could adapt as the situation required.  He did say that it was a special favor from the orphanage to work me in later than the rest of you.”
    
    “Really,” Gordon said.  He smiled a little, “Why would the orphanage be so eager to get rid of you?”
    
    “Because I’m intolerable,” I replied, smiling back.
    
    “Going by the fact that we’ve been seen together, and we’re being seen together now, who are you, and how do we know you?” Gordon asked.
    
    I shrugged, and I was reminded of just how uncomfortable the uniform was, and the spots where it was rubbing against the new skin.  “I’m an orphan.  We were about the same age, I offered to show you around town.”
    
    “That won’t go over well,” Gordon said.
    
    “I’m betting it won’t,” I said.  “Scrubby kid with messy hair from wrong side of the tracks.  I’ll stick out.”
    
    “Which is your plan,” Gordon concluded.
    
    “In part.  But before that… what have you done so far?  What angles have been covered?”
    
    “Oh, you know me,” Gordon said.  “It’s only been a week and I’m almost the best student in my class, best at sports, and most can’t even bring themselves to hate me for it.  I’ve been mingling with the top dogs among the boys here.  Helen’s done the same for the girls.  Between the two of us, we’ve been able to get the word on who the victims were, as well as keep an eye out for who the potential victims might be.”
    
    “Anything conclusive?”
    
    “Less than I’d like.  We’ve asked for extra help to get up to speed with our classes, and that’s let us keep an ear to the ground when it comes to the faculty.  There’s a chance that the person turning children into murder weapons is one of the teachers.”
    
    “Only a chance?”
    
    “Every weekend, students go to the Academy.  Get a taste of it, keeps them invested in Mothmont.  Split up into groups based on interest and age.  Students who were extra good get special lessons with professors.”
    
    “That’s… messy,” I said.  “Too many things to cover.  You didn’t visit me?”
    
    “I was recovering from being poisoned,” Gordon said.  “Lillian was hovering, making sure nobody had reason to get too curious about me.  That left only Helen and Jamie, and they were busy following up on likelies.”
    
    “Poison, huh?  I wasn’t expecting that.”
    
    “That was the most successful attempt out of the three, two for me, one for Jamie.  One object fell from the roof, almost caving Helen’s head in, and Jamie very nearly got pushed in front of a fast moving coach while he was on his way to the Academy.  Helen saved him.”
    
    I nodded slowly.  “No sightings?”
    
    “They’re careful.  And they’re a they, we’re pretty sure.  Plural.”
    
    “Okay,” I said.  “Starting to get a more complete mental picture.”
    
    My eyes glanced over the collection of youths around us.  Would there be overt signs?  They couldn’t be too obvious, or the others would have noticed.
    
    Without knowing more about how the murders were being done, I didn’t know what to look for.  We were surrounded, and letting our guard down could be dangerous.
    
    Jamie, maybe thinking I was still hurt that they hadn’t come for me, commented, “I looked for you at the Tower, poked my head into Hayle’s department, to check the labs to see if you were around, and because I wanted to ask a quick question about Gordon and the poison.  I got word on where you were, but I didn’t have much time to look around.”
    
    Hm.  I probably would have been where Jamie looked for me if I hadn’t barred myself in the office after my appointment.  Live and learn.
    
    The Tower, Mr. Hayle’s department opposite end of the Academy campus from the Hedge where I’d been, was largely focused on research and development regarding the brain.  Widely viewed as a dead end, the department had defaulted to handling a lot of information storage, memory banks, and files.
    
    If Jamie had been there… I spoke my thoughts aloud, “Jamie went to the Tower because… you guys were thinking about mind control?  Something to do with the brain?”
    
    “We were thinking it could be some neurological manipulation,” Jamie said.  “Helen was looking into hormones and drugs at Claret Hall.”
    
    Claret Hall being the center of campus, where students gathered and ate, where key administration facilities were available, and where some of the key elements of the campus and core classes were taught.  If all aspects of Radham flowed from the Academy, then all aspects of the Academy flowed from Claret Hall.
    
    “And you didn’t find anything,” I said.  “If you had, you would have told me.”
    
    “Nothing meaningful,” Jamie said.
    
    I nodded.
    
    Gordon’s head turned.  I followed his gaze.  Students were still playing, gathering in groups, but his focus wasn’t on the students.  “More teachers appearing around the doors.”
    
    “Trouble?” I asked.
    
    “In a way.  We’re out of time.  Lunch is over.  If you’re going to fill us in, now’s the time to do it.”
    
    “We’re close enough to the door that people will see us,” I observed.  “Everyone but Helen, keep an eye on the crowd.  Don’t be obvious about it, but keep an eye out for hints.”
    
    “What am I doing?”  Helen asked.
    
    A shrill whistle drew the attention of the various students.  It sounded again.  A teacher was signaling for others to come indoors.  Hordes of students began moving toward the doors.  Some lingered, like we were, and some were quickly wrapping up their games.
    
    “Fix my hair,” I instructed Helen, “Give me a kiss on the cheek or something, be tender about it.”
    
    “I like you?” Helen asked.
    
    “You’re a big sister to me, but actually acting like a normal big sister.  It can be misinterpreted.”
    
    She hadn’t quite adopted her deadpan expression, but as I gave my order, her expression changed.  She smiled, and it was warm.
    
    “Your hair is a mess,” she said, and her voice matched her expression.  She reached up and fussed with it, running her long fingernails against my scalp as she fixed it up a bit.  Probably better than I could have if I’d had a comb and more time.  She fixed the hair that went from the center of my hairline to my temple, brushing it up and more out of the way, and then let her hand linger, a quarter second too long.  “You should focus more on appearances.”
    
    “I should,” I said.  “There’s time to learn.”
    
    “I can always teach you the particulars,” she said.  “If you’re able to keep yourself in one piece long enough.  I’m glad to see you’ve been put back together.”
    
    She gave me a rub on the arm where I’d been burned, then leaned close to kiss me on the forehead.
    
    Again, her face remained closer to mine for just a heartbeat longer than it needed to.  With the proximity, I couldn’t help but think that I found her scarier than I’d found the snake charmer’s experiment.  I knew it was purely my imagination, but I imagined it was how I’d feel if I was dropped in a tiger’s enclosure at the zoo, the resident sitting the same distance from me.
    
    Still, I smiled.  “I like me being in one piece too.”
    
    I didn’t look, but I was very aware that of the large group that was filing into the door, a great many boys were paying a great deal of attention to the exchange.
    
    “In we go,” I said.  “Keep an eye out.”
    
    We joined the crowd.  Gordon took up the rear, guarding our backs.
    
    I only realized at the last second that him watching our backs was a bad thing.  A hand reached out in my peripheral vision, and Gordon caught it.
    
    “Woah there, Bruno,” a boy our age said, “Ease up.”
    
    Gordon let go of the hand.  “Calling me names, now?”
    
    “Just poking fun.  I’m a pal, Gordon.  Relax,” the boy said.  He pulled his hand free of Gordon’s grip.
    
    The boy was dark haired, with dark brown eyes, but very much of the same type as Gordon.  Big, healthy in stature and build without showing a hint of being fat, handsome, and confident enough that he was probably one of the top dogs.  Between me and Gordon in size, a couple inches taller than me, an inch shorter than Gordon.  Twelve or so?
    
    He smiled at me.  “Who’s slick here?”
    
    “Sy.  Sylvester if you want to be polite,” Gordon said.  “Showed us around before we made our way to Mothmont.  Sylvester, this is Ed.  Ed is a good guy to know if you want to know people.  We’ve been hanging out.”
    
    “Nice way to put it.  You mentioned you’d figured out where things were,” the boy said.  “Hi Helen, Lil, and Ja- James?”
    
    “Jamie.”
    
    “Jamie.  Sorry.”
    
    We were moving with the rest of the crowd, heading into the school proper.  I was very aware of those who were moving past me.  If they were as brazen as the others had insinuated, I wasn’t sure a knife wouldn’t find one of us while we were part of this press of bodies.
    
    “Tell me about yourself, Sy,” Ed urged me.
    
    “Nothing to tell,” I said.  “I’m nobody important.”
    
    Reel him in…
    
    Ed laughed, but it was a laugh for his own benefit, and probably for the others who were watching from a distance.  “You don’t get into Mothmont without being important somehow.”
    
    “Got in on an ask,” I said.  “I’m from the orphanage.”
    
    “Yeah?” he asked, and there was interest in his voice, with a hint of something else.  The question had more than basic curiosity backing it.  “How’s that work?”
    
    “Someone liked me, I guess,” I said.  I shot Helen a smile.  She smiled back.
    
    “That’s not really an answer, buddy,” he said, but there was a bit of a push to the statement.  Insistence.  Not just that, but really, ‘buddy’?  He was acting like he was an adult and I was the kid, but he only had a few inches on me.  It irritated, and I was feeling particularly irritable.
    
    “Only answer I’m going to give,” I said.  “Don’t worry about it.”
    
    I saw a flicker of annoyance on his face.  He blew a bit of air through his lips, “Pff.  I was just being friendly, there’s no need to brush me off.”
    
    “I’m not brushing you off.  I’m hinting that you’re butting your nose in where it isn’t wanted.”
    
    Ed laughed, again, and I could hear a distinct difference between the laugh now and the laugh just a few seconds ago.  Tighter at the edges.  More forced than natural.
    
    We were in the hallway between various classrooms, and the crowd was thinning out, which made me feel a little less worried for my own skin.  The classrooms each had windows between the class and the hallway, and the window frames were grown, large pieces of broken glass collected with what looked like tree branches growing to hold them in place, glass effectively filling the gaps between each branch.  Past those windows and the classrooms, I could see the yard and the street beyond the school.
    
    Things were so clean.  Bright, crisp, all polished and white-painted wood.  I didn’t like it when things were this done-up.  It felt dishonest.  Nicer people tried to make something look, the less I trusted it.
    
    A place as nice as this, trying to be classy?  Murderous students felt like the least of its problems.
    
    “Sy’s usually like this,” Gordon said, “Don’t worry about it, Ed.”
    
    Ed was smiling, but it was a forced smile in the same way the laugh had been.  “I’m not worried, really.  I just have to wonder about the company you keep.”
    
    “Wonder?  Why?” I asked.  Keeping him talking, talking on his feet.  I was more comfortable with a fast-moving conversation than most.
    
    “You’ve been given a rosy opportunity like this, kid like you in a place like this, me offering a hand in friendship, and you snub me?  Not wise, limiting yourself like that.”
    
    “Kid like me, huh?”  Force him to justify, put myself apparently off balance, trying to adjust, adapt…
    
    “Kid like you.  Of less established breeding, no offense.”
    
    He totally meant offense.  It killed me that he was giving me a golden line like that and I couldn’t give it what it deserved.  I had to go easy.
    
    “No offense taken,” I said, smiling.  There was a teacher not too far away, watching the children in the hallway, making sure her students made their way to her class without dallying.  I gave my response, smiling at him. “It’s funny.”
    
    He didn’t seem to comprehend.  Now I had the reins of the dialogue.  He was forced to ask.  “Funny?”
    
    “Someone clearly inbred talking about my breeding.  It-”
    
    He grabbed me by the front of my uniform and shoved me against the wall, hard.  Some students around us gasped, stopping in their tracks or forming a loose circle around us.
    
    The teacher had noticed, and was heading our way.
    
    “Woah there, Bruno,” I echoed him from earlier.
    
    He pulled me away, then shoved me against the wall again.
    
    Then there was laughter.
    
    Helen.  She had one hand to her mouth, and in her attempts to stifle a giggle, she ‘accidentally’ snorted.
    
    Ed stared at her.  There was something raw in the look.
    
    Whatever else he was, he was still only twelve or so.  He could be good with words, handsome, smart, whatever else it took to be one of the top dogs of Mothmont, but he was new to liking girls, and he was very conscious of his other friends, who were hanging back, watching.
    
    “Sorry,” she told him.  “Really, Edward, I’m sorry.  But you have to admit Sy’s line was funny.”
    
    I love you, Helen, I thought.  She’d figured out my angle and here she was, supporting me perfectly.
    
    The teacher was forging his way through the ring of students.  Ed had noticed, and he had to save face.  Had it not been for Helen, he might have socked me one in the stomach and left it be until later.  But he couldn’t very well hit me without going against her.
    
    He was cornered.
    
    “This isn’t over,” he said.  “We’re going to continue this later.”
    
    “Are we?  Easy to say, but so many chicken out.”
    
    He leaned close and whispered, “After classes, in the corner of the yard, where the two trees will give us some privacy,” he said, making a show of letting go of my uniform.
    
    “I’ll believe it when I see you there,” I murmured my response.
    
    The teacher broke through.  Ed pulled away, hands in the air.
    
    “What’s this?” the teacher asked, stern, one hand on her hip.
    
    “Nothing,” I said.  “All good.”
    
    “All good,” Ed joined in.  “Just playing.”
    
    She gave us a curious look.  “Get to your classes.  Mary, Eliza, I see you talking there, get to your desks, I’m starting the lesson soon.”
    
    Her attention was already elsewhere, gathering up and ordering around kids she knew she had clout with.  The rest fell in step.
    
    “I’m disappointed, Gordon,” Ed said.
    
    “We can talk later?” Gordon asked.  “Don’t want bad blood between us.”
    
    “Maybe, sure,” Ed said, but Gordon wasn’t his focus here, or even second in his focus.  The boy left, turning his back to Helen and me as he rejoined friends, hands in his pockets.
    
    Lillian and Helen hurried to their next class, Helen shooting me a smile.
    
    “When you set your mind to it, you’re remarkably good at getting people to hate you,” Gordon said.  “Poor sap.”
    
    “Me or him?”
    
    “Him,” Gordon said, sounding offended at the question.  “You and Helen teaming up on him.  Why’d you go and do that to him?  You knew you’d get someone’s goat by having Helen be gentle to you, and you did, and then you twisted the damn knife.  If you wanted to verify that he wasn’t one of the people who were trying to kill us, you could have asked me.”
    
    “Oh, I wasn’t thinking that,” I said.
    
    “What were you thinking, then?”
    
    “They say when you go to prison, you should murder someone or join a gang.  Idea is that you want to figure out the pecking order and fit yourself into it somehow.”
    
    “Uh huh,” Gordon said.  He glanced around, noting that the number of students in the hallway had thinned out pretty dramatically.  We were almost alone, and the students that were around were hurrying.  “This isn’t prison.”
    
    “The hell it isn’t.  But that’s beside the point.”
    
    “Then why bring it up?” He was quick to retort.
    
    I sighed, “I’m establishing the pecking order.”
    
    “Sy,” he said.  He put both hands on my shoulders, leaning close.  “I hate to say it…”
    
    “You love to say it.”
    
    “In all the years I’ve known you, watching you from the beginning, I have never ever known you to win a fight.  Or even put in a good showing.”
    
    “I didn’t say I’d be at the top of the pecking order,” I protested.
    
    Gordon stepped back, and he looked at Jamie.
    
    “To be fair, he didn’t,” Jamie said.
    
    “We just got him back, and we’re going to have to send him right back to the Academy for more medical care,” Gordon said.
    
    “It won’t be that bad,” I protested, again.
    
    “What are you shooting for, Sly?” Jamie asked.  “Gotta fill us in.”
    
    “You guys stalled because you’re too safe.  Were you watching the crowd?”
    
    “Yeah,” Gordon said.  Jamie nodded.
    
    “Anyone paying too much attention?  Trying not to look like they were looking?”
    
    Gordon shook his head.
    
    “A few faces caught my eye,” Jamie said.  “I can point them out later.”
    
    “We shake things up, see what happens,” I said.  “What moves, what doesn’t, what doesn’t move like it should.  We pay attention to what comes next, and we might get clues.  I just happened to draw everyone’s attention, and whoever was paying attention to you lot is paying extra special attention to me now.  I’m betting they’re confused.”
    
    “I suspect the only person who really gets how you think is you, Sy,” Gordon said.
    
    “Helen gets me,” I said.
    
    “Helen is-” Gordon started.  “Yeah.”
    
    “I get it too.  But you should be ready.  You might be a target, Sy,” Jamie said.
    
    “I know.  I expect it.  You guys have been worrying about knives in the back or poisonings up until now, it’s only fair I have my turn at it.  The way and timing of their response is going to be important, so keep your eyes open.”
    
    Gordon and Jamie nodded.
    
    We were getting dirty looks from teachers that were just starting their classes.
    
    “Pass it on to the girls?” I asked.
    
    “I will,” Gordon said.  “Watch yourselves.”
    
    I nodded.
    
    Jamie and I resumed our trek to our class.
    
    “He’s not good at this,” Jamie said.  “This kind of task.”
    
    “Yeah,” I said, glancing back at Gordon.
    
    “His talents don’t really lend themselves to it.  Maybe one day, but not today.”
    
    “This is more my domain,” I said.  “Helen’s.  Yours to a lesser degree.”
    
    Jamie nodded.
    
    “Speaking of your domain, what’s the scoop on the guy I just picked a fight with?”
    
    “I don’t know.  He’s not in our classes.  Gordon’s kept an eye on him, I haven’t had a reason to.”
    
    I frowned.
    
    “You’re not worried, are you?”
    
    “I figured if I had a few choice attacks I could fire his way, I could position myself better.  I don’t want to be at the very bottom of any pecking orders.”
    
    “Uh huh,” Jamie said.  “I’ll find out.”
    
    Jamie’s long hair was pulled back into a sailor’s ponytail, low and resting against the neck, which wasn’t how he normally wore it.  It was nearly invisible with his collar up.  I reached out and flicked it with my finger.
    
    He jabbed me in response, which prompted me to bump his shoulder with my own, almost sending him into the nearest classroom door.  He did the same to me, to less effect.
    
    The exchange continued for a few seconds, until he stopped all at once. “Stop, we’re at the class.  They’ll see.”
    
    I immediately fell back into a regular walk, pulling my uniform top down.  Still in the hallway, we had to walk by the tree-branch window that ran along the length of the classroom to reach the door.  Jamie pushed his glasses up his nose and fixed his ponytail.
    
    When he was all fixed up, I surreptitiously gave him a jab in the side of his stomach with one of my fingers.
    
    “I’ll get you for that,” he murmured.  He opened the door.
    
    “You’re late,” the teacher said.
    
    “The headmistress said Jamie should show me around,” I said.
    
    The woman pursed her lips.  “I see.  Take your seats, please.  You can sit by Jamie…”
    
    “Sylvester.”
    
    “Sylvester.  Thank you.  Get the notes from Jamie later.  For now, just sit and follow what you can.”  She walked over to her desk and made a note on what I assumed was an attendance list.
    
    I was very aware of the subtle smiles or glances from various students.  Ones that had seen Ed pushing me up against the wall, knowing full well that I’d been stretching the truth.  My eye quickly traveled over the boys and girls that weren’t smiling.
    
    I wouldn’t be able to remember the particulars, which ones looked like they were trying too hard not to look at me, or who weren’t.
    
    Jamie would.
    
    “Now, back to what I was saying.  Wollstone’s ratios are used in seventy percent of what you’ll be doing if you go on to attend the Academy.  The golden ratio, seen here, could be said to be the precursor to what would eventually be Wollstone’s nine ratios.  With a few quick measurements, we can quickly divine which of the nine ratios is used for a given organism’s physical structure or composition, and working backward, so long as we can keep to the ratio, we can trust that the organism has the fundamental supports for life.
    
    “For example, if you’ll turn to page seventy-five, we can see where the fundamental pattern of a cat is outlined.  Keeping to Wollstone’s ‘wise’ ratio, we can discern which parts of the pattern apply to specific parts of the cat.  Now, it gets more complicated when we decide to alter the pattern, or the how of it, but you should begin to have a glimmer of how a ratio can be used as a shortcut to understanding…”
    
    My forehead hit the desk.  I closed my eyes and tried to fall asleep.
    
    ☙
    
    To his credit, Ed did know how to throw a punch.  He knew how to throw ten.
    
    To my credit, I managed to stay on my feet until the tenth punch.  I didn’t manage to deliver anything substantial in the meantime, but I wasn’t curling up into a ball and crying uncle.
    
    The group of students around us was smaller than I would have liked.  The Lambsbridge orphans, Ed and Gordon’s friends, and Helen’s group.  Girls for Ed to impress.  Maybe it would make up for my baiting him, if he got to look good in front of some girls.
    
    Landing at the base of the tree, I took a second to catch my breath.  I raised a hand to make Ed stop.
    
    “You done?” he asked.  “You’re not going to say anything about my family again?”
    
    “I didn’t say anything until you-“
    
    I saw him bringing a fist back, ready to hit me again.
    
    I opened my mouth wide, wincing at the feeling at the corner of my jaw.  Tight.
    
    In the process, I saw a movement in the corner of my eye.
    
    There weren’t many windows that offered a good look at the scene.  Three trees had been planted at one corner of the yard, between the glass roof and the building, and they blocked the view from many of the nearby windows.  They also served to keep most of the rain off us.  Only the girls were wearing hoods and jackets, and I was getting dirty, but not muddy, which was better.
    
    We hadn’t been obvious about our fight, and anyone who had a reason to watch was going to be part of this crowd.  But, still, three boys had paid enough attention to us to know the fight was happening, and had found one vantage point inside where they could peer past the gaps in the branches and watch what was happening.  One, thirteen or so, was standing in a way that let the curtain block the lower half of his face.  The other was far younger, nine or ten, and was leaning forward, hands folded on the windowsill, peering over the bottom of the window to look down at me.  The third was somewhere between the two in age, and hung far enough back to be hidden in the gloom of an unlit classroom.
    
    The look in their eyes was clear enough.
    
    As curious as we were about the murderous children, they were curious about us.  They couldn’t know me well enough to know how I operated.  Even Mr. Hayle didn’t, and he’d practically designed me.
    
    Ed jabbed me in the middle with the toe of one shoe.  “Eh?”
    
    “We’re good,” I said.  “Sorry about saying you’re inbred, Ed.”
    
    He didn’t look appeased.
    
    I glanced toward the classroom again.  The boys were gone.
    
    “Come on,” Gordon said.  “Let’s get you looked after.”
    
    I nodded.
    
    “Saw them,” I murmured, as he helped me limp on.
    
    “Where?”
    
    “Inside.  Three boys.  I can give Jamie partial descriptions.”
    
    “Three boys,” Gordon mused.  “That’s not good.”
    
    “Poisonings are usually done by women,” Helen said, as she joined us.  “Meaning we’re dealing with four.”
    
    “At least,” I agreed."""
    
    taking_root.append(taking_root_4)
    
    taking_root_5 = """Taking Root one point five. I watched as Jamie used a pen to sketch out a rough image.
    
    “Head was narrower.  Taller than wide,” I commented.
    
    “Most heads are.”
    
    “That looks round.  Also, he didn’t look sinister, but he didn’t look interested either.  It was cold.”
    
    “Like Helen sometimes looks?”
    
    I considered.  “No.”
    
    “You, then.  On a bad day, after an appointment?”
    
    “I don’t know what I look like after an appointment.  They don’t usually let me have access to reflective surfaces, and I’m not usually gawking at myself, either.”
    
    Jamie leaned back in his chair, and his head bumped my chest, where I was leaning over the back of the chair.
    
    He remained where he was, looking up at me.  “You had a look in your eyes like all the joy had gone out of the world.”
    
    “Depressed?”
    
    “No,” Jamie said.  “Um…”
    
    He turned a page in his notebook.
    
    On the fresh page, he began to sketch.  He was using a fountain pen that flowed fairly freely, but his hand moved with some speed and dexterity.  It was interesting to see, because Jamie wasn’t a strong artist.  He made my eyes too small, the position slightly wrong, paused, then went back, expanding, making the top of the eye into my eyebrows, and drawing my eyes at a larger size.  It was a rough sketch, and it was a sketch that showed my face in heavy shadow, the lines noticeable, thick.
    
    At first I took it for a caricature, exaggerating my features, but Jamie wasn’t good enough to do that.  The hair was drawn in messy, framing it all, and the lines marked my cheeks as being more gaunt, with thin cross-hatching for the shadows in the recesses, I realized that it wasn’t a recent picture, that my eyes were larger in proportion to the rest because it was a picture of me, years younger.
    
    Near the beginning.
    
    Drawing from memory, rather than talent.
    
    I leaned forward, and it was as though I were looking into a mirror cast in paper.  My eyes were narrow, my lips thin and slightly parted, and all the features of my face and ears were fine to the point of being sharp.
    
    Jamie was already putting down notes below and to the side of the image.  I glanced at the first.
    
    Drawn for a discussion with Sly, during the Case of the Bad Seeds.
    
    “Case of the bad seeds,” I commented idly.
    
    “Placeholder,” he said.  He was already going on to write more.  Normally I wouldn’t have been able to resist reading over his shoulder, but I found I couldn’t keep my eyes off the image for long.  The eyes were just scratches of black ink, almost hidden in the shadows that had been etched around them, but they took up much of the focus.
    
    “This was… that time I had to do two appointments, back to back?”  I asked.  Only time my cheeks would have been that hollow.
    
    Jamie didn’t respond, but his pen moved, indicating a line he’d just jotted down.  He tapped his fountain pen against paper, leaving three blotchy dots in the margin.
    
    From memory: Sly in the Tower, after he ran away.  Before he recovered from one month’s appointment, he had to do the next.
    
    Reading the line, I suddenly felt excruciatingly uncomfortable, and the hour-old bruises from my encounter with Ed weren’t why.  Feeling so restless I couldn’t bear it, I turned away from Jamie, his chair, and his book, and I paced across our little dorm room.  Two beds each with a chest at the foot, one desk, and one bedside table between the beds with drawers for us to share.  Mothmont was fancy, but not so fancy that we each got a palace.  Real estate mattered, if nothing else.
    
    “We didn’t think we’d get you back,” Jamie murmured.  “We suspected you were lost.”
    
    “That’s not it,” I said, forcing my voice to sound different from how I felt.  I worried I didn’t sell it very well.  “No.  It’s not like Helen is, and it’s not like that, okay?  That’s not the look they had.”
    
    “Okay,” Jamie said, sounding very normal, placid, and very calm.
    
    Though I didn’t like it, I was finding the conversation helped me to clarify my interpretation.  “They weren’t lost.  There was emotion there.  They were human, but they weren’t nice humans.”
    
    “You’re not a nice human sometimes,” Jamie remarked.
    
    I shot him a look.
    
    “Only saying, Sly, only saying.”
    
    “I looked at them, and I knew they were the sorts who’d stick their parents with something sharp and then light up the family home.  Or try to drop a piece of masonry on someone they didn’t like.”
    
    “You’d-”
    
    I narrowed my eyes, making the look darker and more intense.
    
    He seemed to give up, pulling his hands away from the page, slumping back.  “Yeah, Sy.  Got it.  But if you can’t tell me how they looked all murderous, I’m not sure I can draw it.  I’m not sure I can draw them in the first place.”
    
    “It’s fine,” I said.  “Don’t fret about it.”
    
    “Think you’d recognize them if you saw them?”
    
    “If I saw them?  No.  They were standing in shadow.  If I talked to them, maybe.”
    
    “There are one thousand, two hundred students at Mothmont, give or take, ranging from year one to year twelve.  It’s going to take you an awful long time to talk to them all.”
    
    “Yeah,” I said.  I was still on the far side of the room.  Three sets of my uniform had been provided, alongside a little cloak and hood for the rain and an umbrella, all stacked neatly on the chest at the end of the bed.  My bedside drawer had a new comb, bottle of toothwash, washcloth, and a new set of books.
    
    Nothing that was mine.  I didn’t like it.  The office back at the hedge with the grille on the windows and the bookcase blocking the door had felt less like a cell than this.
    
    There, I’d been free to be me.  Here, I was being made to conform, just like some of the fruit I’d seen grown at the Academy, placed inside molds that would shape their growth.  Fruit shaped like certain animals, or like human faces.
    
    Were our murder-children in that same situation?
    
    I frowned.  “I’m thinking…”
    
    “Yeah?”  Jamie twisted in his seat, elbow over the back of the chair.
    
    “Why here?” I asked.
    
    “Resources are available, on multiple fronts.  You’ve got access to children, you’ve got access to tools and starter labs.  Maybe things go missing, maybe it gets put back at the end of the day?”
    
    “Maybe,” I said.  “One way or another, something is going on with their heads.  Either they’re being made to do something they normally wouldn’t, or they’re not them, and something more nefarious is going on.”
    
    “Nefarious?”
    
    “There are parasites that induce suicidal behavior in the host as part of the life cycle.”
    
    “Sure.  Transoplasma Felidae.  Feverish behavior and a compulsion to drown oneself.  Weaponized version was Transoplasma Necis, but that saw reams of people biting off their own tongues to choke on the tongue or aspirating the blood.  Well known enough.”
    
    “I’ll take your word for it.  Maybe the students we’re talking about have a parasite in their heads, something that’s making them act funny.  Maybe we’re dealing with the parasites and not the children themselves.”
    
    Jamie seemed to consider a moment.  “Raises questions.”
    
    “You ask, I try to justify.”
    
    “Why do they care about us?”
    
    “They’re complex.  Pre-set instructions.”
    
    Jamie shook his head.  “I don’t buy that someone capable of that would be here and not at the Academy, making a fortune.”
    
    “Then they’re paranoid.  Like they’re rabid, they’re wary of everything.”
    
    “Why us?”
    
    I started to come up with an explanation, then dismissed it.  Felt weak, like too much of a reach.  “What if it made them suggestible?  Broke down the walls in their heads, left them open to receiving instruction?  Get access to the children, slip them something that leaves them open to being influenced.”
    
    “We’d see it in their behavior,” Jamie said.
    
    “What?  That they’d be willing to take orders?  Follow the rest of the sheep?  We’re in a school, Jamie,” I said.
    
    “Point.”
    
    “A highbrow school.  Look, I’m not sold on the parasite idea.  But we’ve got an awful lot of children here, ones that might be more vulnerable to whatever, or of an age where some symptoms might be easier to hide.  Maybe the fact that we’re all fitting into some cookie cutter archetype is an advantage for our puppeteer in the background.  If their little experiments feel disoriented?  Have lost memories?  If their behavior is a little outside the norm?  All our ‘bad seed’ has to do is imitate their peers.”
    
    Jamie was nodding, already thinking the idea through, rounding it out, “If they act too far out of line, then the faculty steps in, gets them to shape up.  If that fails…”
    
    “What happens when someone futzes up and doesn’t look like they’re going to straighten out?”
    
    “Detention,” Jamie said.  “Or a talk with the headmistress.  You don’t think she’s the one doing it?”
    
    I rolled my head to one side, then the other.  “I talked to the woman.  I didn’t get that sense out of her.”
    
    “Why?”
    
    I gave Jamie an annoyed look.
    
    “It’s good to think about why,” Jamie said, his voice quiet but not meek.  “You have a good sense of things, but it’s important to identify the details that are feeding into that sense.  You see little details, and your brain picks them up and puts them into storage, while your conscious mind doesn’t register them.  Prey animals use that low-level awareness a lot, figuring out that a predator could be nearby, and we still have traces of that prey thinking.”
    
    “I don’t see myself as a prey animal,” I said, smiling.
    
    “The idea is sound, Sy.  We all use that sense to some extent, but you’re a little better than most.  You can train it, but training it starts with being aware.  Think about your surroundings, pay attention to the details, and-”
    
    A knock sounded at the door.
    
    “You two decent in there?” Gordon asked, voice muffled by the intervening door.
    
    “Am I ever decent?” I asked.
    
    The door opened.  But it wasn’t just Gordon, which surprised me.  He was accompanied by a boy, narrow in build, with thick eyebrows and wiry black hair cut a finger’s width from his head.  It didn’t look like one of the boys that would be in Gordon’s cadre.
    
    “We ran into each other at the door,” Gordon said.
    
    “I know him,” Jamie said.  “Book trade?”
    
    “Yeah,” the boy said.  He held out two dime novels.  “Read them?”
    
    Jamie glanced at the novels, “Yes.  But it’s fine.  I’ll trade.”
    
    He opened a drawer in the desk, pulling out five more dime novels.  “Doll Man and the song of the moon?”
    
    “Read it.”
    
    “Doll man and the revenge of the swarm queen?”
    
    “That’s out?”  The boy stuck out his hand.  Jamie dutifully handed over the book, no more than a hundred pages.
    
    “I liked this one,” Jamie said, “But you might want to wait until there’s more material.”
    
    “What’s that?” the boy asked.
    
    “Huh?” Jamie asked.
    
    I turned, and I started to cross the room, before I saw Gordon moving in the same direction.  He was faster, and he was closer.  I deferred to him.
    
    Before Jamie was able to process just what had grabbed the boy’s attention, Gordon touched the cover of Jamie’s notebook and flipped it over.  It slapped closed and slid a bit across the desk.
    
    Jamie put a hand out to stop it.
    
    “That’s Jamie’s journal,” Gordon said.  “You don’t read someone’s journal, pal.”
    
    “Oh,” the boy said.  He turned a little pink.  “Didn’t know, sorry Jamie.”
    
    “It’s okay,” Jamie said.
    
    “That picture was something.  Scary, if I can say so,” the boy said, turning to look at me.  “That was you?”
    
    “You don’t comment on someone’s journal if you happen to get a look at it, either,” Gordon said, his voice firm.
    
    The boy’s face turned even pinker.
    
    “Mickey,” Jamie said, offering a bit of relief where I would have pressed the advantage. “Take a look.”
    
    Jamie held the other three little novels so they fanned out.  A lady in white and a rat crawling out of the darkness, a man with a bird mask, and a handsome young man with a dog accompanying him through a forest.
    
    “What’s that last one?” Mickey asked.
    
    Jamie pulled it away before Mickey could grab it.  “When we stopped by the Academy last weekend, you see anyone go off in a very small group?”
    
    “Very small?”
    
    “More than three, less than ten.”
    
    “Uh.  Some special students got instruction with professors, or got to sit in on classes.  Top of certain classes, or something.  But they were alone.”
    
    “Yeah,” Jamie said.
    
    “No, I don’t think so.”
    
    “Okay, thanks anyway,” Jamie said.  He put the books down, then handed over the one Mickey had expressed interest in.  “Barber John and the dark forest monster.”
    
    “Keen.”
    
    Gordon stepped out of the way while the boy headed back to the hallway.  He closed the door behind him, and stood with his back to it.  “Asking questions like that can draw attention.”
    
    “I’m very careful about who I ask,” Jamie said.
    
    “Okay,” Gordon said.  He seemed to take that at face value.  He didn’t mention Jamie’s lapse about the book.
    
    Gordon and I wouldn’t go after Jamie for that any more than any of the others would come after me for my behavior after an appointment.  We had our strengths, and we had our individual weak points.  If everything was working as it should, we covered the weak points and highlighted the strengths.
    
    That meant accepting that sometimes Jamie had enough stuff in his head that he was a little slower to get things rolling when surprised.
    
    If I’d been on the ball, I would have reminded Jamie, but my head hurt.
    
    “It’s time for dinner,” Gordon said.  “Thought I’d check in.”
    
    “Still alive,” I said.  “No surprise murders.”
    
    Gordon’s expression didn’t twitch.  “What do you think?”
    
    “We were thinking maybe the structure of the school is being used to shape or correct behavior where it might go off rails,” Jamie said.  I cleared my throat, and Jamie amended his statement to say, “Sy thought so.  It makes some sense.”
    
    “Something to watch out for?” Gordon asked.
    
    “Quirks in behavior, students pushing the limit and getting pushed back in line by the group,” I said.  “And it might be worth seeing who is in charge of correcting the students when they get too problematic.”
    
    Gordon nodded.  “Our mad doctor or doctors act the role of the murderer, the children are the murder weapon, and that weapon needs to be kept controlled and concealed.  The school is a setting for it.  That still leaves questions.  Who, how, why.”
    
    “Who is the murderer, how are they doing this with the students, and why are they doing it?  What’s the motive?” Jamie asked.
    
    “How, also, are they giving orders?” Gordon asked.  “The students here got orders to kill us.  When?  What form did it take?”
    
    “Food for thought,” I said.  I perked up.  “Speaking of food…”
    
    “That was contrived,” Gordon said.
    
    “Brain feels sluggish, and I haven’t had an actual meal in…” I counted on my fingers, then paused, stuck.  “When did we eat, before the snake charmer?”
    
    Gordon blinked.  “At that point, I think the question is academic.  Have you had water?”
    
    “I had some water, yeah,” I said.
    
    He frowned.  “If you hadn’t, I’d wonder how you were still standing.  Let’s slap a feedbag on that face of yours, Sy.  And you wonder why you’re short.”
    
    I grabbed the comb from the bedside table and hucked it at his head.  He caught it, which didn’t surprise me.
    
    We collected ourselves, getting our things.  Jamie picked up his notebook, tucking it under one arm.  The pen was capped and slipped into a breast pocket.  Gordon was all set up, and all I needed was a bit of protection from any rain.
    
    The school was arranged into a square, with the yard in the middle.  The front entrance sat at the southern wall with the front office, infirmary and other administrative rooms.  The west and east sides of the square had classrooms.  The more interesting area was the northern end, furthest from the entrance.  Here, we had the dorms, boys at the west corner, girls at the east.  The two sides of the dorms were separated by the teacher’s quarters and washrooms on the upper floors, and a spacious dining room on the lower floor.  I supposed the idea was that it made mingling harder.
    
    The dorms were ordered by year, with the older students on the upper floors, and being right in the upper-middle of the range of ages, we were left to make our way down on our way to the dining room.
    
    My eyes searched the crowd, looking for a familiar face or feature.  I’d told Jamie I wasn’t sure if I could place them, but that didn’t stop me from trying.  Kids milled around us.
    
    “Ed was asking about you, before your little tussle under the tree,” Gordon commented.  Keeping the conversation to stuff we could talk about freely.
    
    “Tussle?”
    
    “I’m trying to phrase it so I don’t hurt your feelings, Sy,” Gordon said, sounding as condescending as he was able.  “Because if I was honest, I’d have to say you didn’t just embarrass yourself.  You embarrassed all of us.”
    
    I jabbed him.  He took it without flinching.
    
    “I’m guessing that, following your usual pattern, you’re going to get in trouble, ostensibly to see how the justice system of Mothmont operates?”  Gordon asked.
    
    The question could be taken two ways.  Anyone hearing would think I was a troublemaker, which wasn’t wrong, but he was asking if I’d see which faces or individuals might be tied to the correction of errant students.  Or errant ‘bad seeds’, as the case went.
    
    The maneuver had other uses.  If our opposition here was less graceful, they might well get themselves into trouble, just to follow me or keep an eye on me.  Simply paying attention to see who acted and reacted after I got myself into trouble could reveal a great deal.
    
    But my answer to Gordon was a, “Not just yet.”
    
    “No?”
    
    “Still waiting to see what happens after my brawl with Ed.”
    
    Jamie, trailing a bit behind us, snickered audibly.
    
    Gordon openly scoffed.  “Brawl.  You got beat, Sy.  I was talking to some of the others, and Ed actually got worried when someone suggested that you might be a real scrapper, growing up in the orphanage.  I nearly split something, trying not to laugh.”
    
    “Ha ha,” I said, without humor.
    
    We reached the end of the dining room, and the girls were filtering in through the door on the far side.   It was nice, very spacious, all long tables of dark wood, benches, with the two sides separated by a buffet style table.
    
    The kitchen was visible, a recessed area, with the chefs busy at work over various stoves.  Students aged twelve to sixteen were wearing aprons, carrying food out.  Racks of bread, bowls of salad and empty glasses were placed on the table, while larger pots of food were placed on the buffet table, beside stacks of plates.  Stew, soups, and portions of meat.
    
    From the smell in the kitchen, they were already working on dessert.
    
    I took it all in, studying it.  The system.
    
    Gordon leaned close, murmuring, “Put yourself into their shoes.  How many ways can you see, to poison someone?”
    
    “Pre-assigned seats?” I asked.
    
    “No, but they’ll call us together by homeroom for a roll call soon,” Jamie said.
    
    “Make sure all the students are present and accounted for,” Gordon elaborated.
    
    Dust the glasses with something, poison the silverware, deliver the poison while serving water, refresh the bread bowl or salad, drop something in the food while we go from the buffet to our seats, or simply take advantage of the bumps and shoves that come with being in a crowd of hungry students to stick us with a needle.
    
    “Seven off the top of my head.”
    
    “Lillian and I counted out twelve ways they could’ve gotten me, looking back in retrospect,” Gordon murmured.  “Jamie and Helen added one each once they got back from the Academy.”
    
    “Kind of takes the joy out of eating for the first time in a week,” I murmured.
    
    “You shouldn’t eat too much on an empty stomach anyway,” Jamie said.
    
    I made a face, but I didn’t take my eyes off the crowd.  I saw Helen and Lillian on the other side.  Helen had a bevvy of girls around her, and she was playing it up.  Lillian stood off to one side, talking to a teacher.
    
    Oddly in her element, in a very not-the-way-she-acts-at-home way.
    
    “Incidentally,” I said, still looking over the crowd for a glimpse of the boys I’d seen through the window.  I didn’t see any telltale signs, and I certainly didn’t see them together as a group.  “What do we do if I happen to spot a possible culprit?”
    
    “Signal me and Helen.  We’ll go after him.”
    
    I nodded.  “Easier if you’re together.”
    
    “We’ll sit together as a group.”
    
    “Okay,” I said.
    
    Sure enough, we were called to specific tables by our homeroom teachers.  They read our names off of lists, and then gave the official go-ahead to get food.
    
    I held back out of the way while everyone stampeded for the buffet table, or ran over to reunite with friends.  Nobody returned to the seats they’d been in for the nightly attendance, and the teachers didn’t enforce anything.  There were striations by year and groupings of cliques, but no divisions beyond that.
    
    Helen approached with a group of her friends, while Gordon went to go talk to his clique.  The teenagers had all gathered around the buffet table and were screening out the kids, claiming first pick, but Gordon’s group looked set to take up the first gap that formed.
    
    I appreciated that he going out of his way to stay in our line of sight, allowing us to watch his back.
    
    “Sy, was it?” one of Helen’s older friends asked.  An attractive brunette with her hair in a short bob.  She’d hiked up her skirt just a fraction beneath her uniform top, so the bottom of the skirt was higher, revealing more of her very nice looking legs.
    
    I realized I’d been caught looking, and met her eyes without a trace of shame or guilt, “You can call me whatever you want, so long as you give me your name first, and maybe the number of your dorm room.”
    
    She smiled, amid some ‘oohs’ from other girls in the group, then gave me a pat on the head.  “That was a good try, and it might have worked, but you’re a little too young for me, and I like the idea of a man who can stand up for me.”
    
    “You saw my duel with Ed,” I spoke my realization aloud.
    
    “I did,” she said.  “I’d offer some comforting words, but the less that’s said, the better.”
    
    “I could say I let him win,” I said.
    
    “Did you?” another girl chimed in, interest piqued.  Blonde, like Helen, but more pixieish in many respects.  Helen could have been an actress or a model, but this girl made me imagine a ballerina, in build and how she was more expressive in general movement.
    
    “No.  But I could say I did,” I said.
    
    “Whatever convinced you to pick a fight with Ed Willard?” the brunette asked.
    
    “Some people are born to be the hero of a story,” I said.  “I was born to be the villain.  I see the charming, good looking, obnoxiously noble type of guy and I feel compelled to start a battle I’m doomed to lose.”
    
    “Does that include monologues while you’re winning and standing over the bloody hero?” another girl asked, a smile on her face, suggesting she was well versed in that sort of thing.  Not many girls read the books and dime novels meant for boys.
    
    “I wouldn’t know,” I said.  “You saw my poor showing earlier.  I haven’t gotten that far.”
    
    I heard a few chuckles and smiles, and belatedly realized that I’d effectively and accidentally drawn the attention of Helen’s entire clique.  Heads at other tables and the buffet line were turning, looking at me as some of the more attractive girls in our grade were grouped around me.
    
    “Okay, wait, I have to poke a hole in your story,” a girl closer to Helen’s and my age declared.  She was a brunette too, but wore her hair longer, with white ribbons that complemented her school uniform.  “You say you don’t get along with good guys, but you get along with Helen’s friend Gordon, don’t you?  If anyone’s noble, it’s him.”
    
    “Oh, Gordon’s a villain at heart,” I said.  “I don’t know if he knows it yet, but there’s a scoundrel in there just screaming for an excuse.”
    
    “How would you know that?” she asked.
    
    “Because when I was showing these guys around, I saw them with all sorts of people, sometimes in the rougher parts of town.  I’ve seen Gordon here, all nice and ordinary, and I’ve seen him go toe to toe with people you wouldn’t want to meet in a dark alley, and they walked away respecting him.”
    
    A half dozen pairs of eyes turned Gordon’s way.  He caught sight of a crowd of girls giving him serious looks and looked about as bewildered as if I’d drawn a gun on him.
    
    Miss Ribbons wasn’t looking though.  She was focused on me, her right eyebrow raised.  “I’m not sure I believe you.”
    
    Pixie-blonde chimed in, turning from Gordon to Ribbons, and then to me.  She put her hands on her hips.  “Are you being a good friend and trying to get us interested in your fellow over there?”
    
    “Maybe,” I said, smiling.
    
    “It’s good if you’ve given up on making yourself look good, because that ship sailed hours ago,” Miss Ribbons commented.
    
    “That’s cruel,” another girl said.  “I quite like Sy, here, and it’s noble of this little villain to play up his friend.”
    
    With the words ‘I quite like Sy’, she put her arms around me, giving me a hug.  I very nearly ducked out of her grip, but a quick glance at each of her hands suggested that they were empty, with no weapon or needle in evidence.  Given the difference in stature, the girl being three years my senior, it pulled the side of my head right into her bosom.
    
    A nearby teacher loudly cleared his throat, and my new friend pulled her arms away, raising her hands as if she were being held up.
    
    “Believe it or not,” Helen said, still smiling, acting very much the young coquette, “Sy isn’t lying.  For once.  What he said about Gordon was true.”
    
    That line spawned more conversation, but my focus was on Gordon.  He navigated his way through eager young students, holding four plates in two hands.  He looked a little wary of joining the group, with so many eyes on him.
    
    “What’s going on?” he asked, once he was close enough to ask.
    
    “Just talking,” Helen said.
    
    “Healthy lad,” the girl who’d hugged me said, indicating Gordon’s plates.
    
    “For my friends,” Gordon said.
    
    Lingering paranoia made me study her expression for any hint of danger.  Had she powdered her shirtfront with a poison that could be inhaled?
    
    Gordon handed us our individual plates, one for me, Helen, Lillian and Jamie, then asked, “Is anyone in dire need of a meal?  I was going to go back to serve myself, but I can get more plates.”
    
    The short-haired brunette raised her hand, smiling way too much at Gordon.
    
    “That’s one,” he said.
    
    “I’m getting waved over,” Miss Ribbons said.  “I need to take over for a friend and start serving.  She’s been in the kitchen all day.”
    
    “Good girl.  Talk to you later,” Helen said.
    
    “Enjoy your meals,” Miss Ribbons said, before dashing off.
    
    I watched her retreat, zig-zagging through the crowd on the way to the kitchen, hair and skirt bouncing before she reunited with the friend she’d mentioned.
    
    She glanced back, looking at me.
    
    “I do think Mary likes Sy,” Pixie-blonde said.
    
    “Does Sy like Mary?” another girl asked.
    
    “I’m going to sit,” Helen said.  “Come sit with us, Sy.  I don’t think these girls are going to let you go, like this.  They’ve got their claws in you, and I don’t think they’ll let you go.”
    
    “Claws?” a girl asked, archly.
    
    Helen, doing her part to keep us together in a very natural seeming way.
    
    It took time before everyone had a plate and food.  My focus was on the crowd, keeping only enough attention on the conversation to keep up with it.  Where were the dynamics?  What were the possible approaches for attack?
    
    I was exceedingly aware of the state of my food.  On such an empty stomach, I couldn’t afford to get poisoned.  We already knew our enemies were aware of us, so I didn’t mind being a little guarded.  One girl commented on it, even, and I explained it away as a casualty of being from the orphanage.  That, in itself, spawned more discussion.
    
    Jamie and Lillian seemed content to be in the background.  Jamie was taking it all in.  If something happened, he’d be able to tell us who was where.
    
    Had I been familiar with the dynamic and the situation, I might have been more on point, aware of when it all started to go wrong.  It tied into what Jamie had said about the prey instinct.  Taking in the subconscious details, things that one’s mind and attention weren’t picking up on.
    
    Changes in volume, shifts in tone.  The behavior of people at the fringes and in the background.
    
    Little boys who were hunched over their plates.
    
    It only clicked when I saw that dessert was being served, and that the cooks and serving girls were looking a little nonplussed.  I paid attention to what they were sensing with their own prey’s instinct.
    
    That dessert was being placed on the table, and very few students seemed inclined to go get it.
    
    Looking around, I saw expressions of pain.  People squirming.  Not a lot, but as I watched, I saw it was getting worse.
    
    I dropped my knife and fork.
    
    “Don’t eat,” I said.
    
    Helen, Gordon, Lillian, and Jamie dropped their utensils.
    
    They didn’t settle for poisoning us.
    
    They poisoned everyone.
    
    Why?
    
    “Oh,” Erma, the pixie-haired blonde said.  “I thought I felt full, but now-”
    
    She raised a hand to her mouth.
    
    “Just nausea?” Lillian asked.  She got a nod.  “Feverish?  Does it hurt?”
    
    Whatever she was feeling, I didn’t experience it.  My friends didn’t either.
    
    Maybe a handful of people had escaped it, whatever it was.
    
    My mind was going a mile a minute as I took it in, tried to figure out the approach.
    
    What was the goal, the plan?
    
    They’d hit everyone, but missed us.  Was it an accident, luck on our part, Gordon being safe?
    
    “The teachers are affected too,” Gordon said.
    
    “It doesn’t seem to be serious,” Lillian said.  “It’ll get explained away as a stomach thing.  Something improperly cooked, perhaps.”
    
    As if to answer her statement, someone threw up.  It seemed to set off a chain reaction.  People were rising from their seats, hurrying out of the dining hall.
    
    “The entire school is going to be shut down,” I said.  “Everyone in their beds for at least the next few hours, if not the next day.”
    
    Everyone.  It’s not a frame, or they would have left the teachers alone, done more to set us up.  Again, I have to wonder… why?
    
    My eye fell on Miss Ribbons.
    
    I felt the uneasiness, watching her.  I saw the look in her eyes.  Just the same as the boys had been.
    
    I jerked my head, and the others looked, following my gaze.  Miss Ribbons was already making a hasty exit, pulling off her apron.  If anyone asked, I bet she’d say she was going to the nurse.
    
    “Nobody to look after us, or keep us out of trouble,” I commented.
    
    Locking down the school.  They were largely free to roam, or to feign being sick until our backs were turned, but I suspected it wouldn’t be so easy or safe for us.
    
    They’re making a play, and we’re still completely in the dark about what they are and what they’re doing."""
    
    taking_root.append(taking_root_5)
    
    taking_root_6 = """Taking Root one point six. With the people starting to vomit or rising from their seats to run for the nearest toilet, it was pretty clear that something was wrong.  Students were getting distressed, and students were getting scared.  The teachers weren’t in great shape either.
    
    Our opposition was smart.  Whatever was going on, they were capable of making plans with multiple phases or steps.  Knowing we’d already served ourselves, they’d tainted the food, affecting most of the other students and teachers.  Probably.  It fit with Miss Ribbons’ actions and the general timeline.
    
    Mary.  Helen’s friends had called her Mary.
    
    Our seats at the table were arranged with intent.  It wasn’t anything we’d blatantly coordinated or organized, but we’d simply accepted it as an approach.  At the table furthest from the kitchen, Jamie, Lillian and I sat on the bench with the wall right behind us, Helen and a share of Gordon’s friends on either side.  Helen and Gordon themselves were opposite Jamie and I, their backs to the rest of the dining room.
    
    The position meant that Jamie and I could observe the room, and getting to us was rather more difficult.  Gordon and Helen could look after themselves, for the most part, if someone happened to approach from behind.
    
    I leaned over to Jamie, and I took advantage of the general noise, bustle, and distraction of the other students to murmur in his ear.  “The other students are too smart to reveal themselves in the midst of this.  Watch the teachers.”
    
    “Sure,” he said.
    
    I met Gordon and Helen’s eyes.  This was an awkward situation, because we couldn’t coordinate by speech without cluing the others in.  If we left, we ran the risk of being blindsided.  When our enemies were in the shadows and we were in plain sight, the chaos here worked very much against us.  While everyone else was distracted or incapacitated, they were free to attack us from any number of angles.  If we happened to die, well, even minor food poisoning could kill.
    
    That in itself was dangerous, but I was willing to bet there were more layers to this attack.  A specific reason they’d done it this way.
    
    “Helen,” Gordon said.  He put a hand on Helen’s shoulder.  “You okay?”
    
    Helen shook her head.  She was already leaning over slightly, one hand to her collarbone.
    
    She very briefly met my eye.
    
    Good.  Play along.
    
    “Do you need help?” Lillian asked.
    
    “Just walk me to our room?” Helen asked.  There was a tension in her voice, as if she were suddenly trying very hard not to puke.
    
    “Lillian isn’t that strong,” Gordon said.  “I’ll help.”
    
    “Boys aren’t allowed on the girl’s side,” was the protest from Erma the pixie-blonde.  She looked visibly green around the gills.
    
    “Special circumstances,” Gordon said.
    
    “You’re really not allowed,” Erma protested, again.
    
    “I really don’t care,” Gordon said, firm.
    
    “We’ll come,” I said.
    
    “Groups of-” Erma started, then bit the sentence short as she fought a wave of nausea.
    
    “Erma,” I said.  “Let us be gentlemen, okay?  We’re mostly okay, I think.  We can walk you to your rooms.”
    
    She didn’t look happy with that idea, but she wasn’t able to talk, either.
    
    Gordon began to stand, helping Helen out of her seat.  He offered a hand to Erma.
    
    “The teachers,” Jamie said, alerting us.
    
    My head turned.  One of the teachers was standing.  He wore slightly old fashioned clothes.  His pants clung to his legs, disappearing into boots, while he wore a bright red jacket over a button-up shirt without a tie.  He had a strong build, with a prominent barrel chest, and the clothing had a way of making his legs look far too small while his upper body was made to look larger.  His hair was the same way, wavy hair across a head that was already very triangular, with a prominent upper brow and pointed chin.
    
    The red jacket was unfortunate, not because it was a sad attempt at acting a member of the upper crust, but because his skin was now very flushed, matching the jacket.  He was sweating, in obvious discomfort.
    
    He hadn’t escaped the effects of the poison.  The man seated to his right and the headmistress another seat down were both looking about as uncomfortable.
    
    Had they eaten more, being larger in build?
    
    “Everyone!” Red-jacket boomed out the word.  He had a faint but real British accent.
    
    The noise level dropped.
    
    “Something in the meal looks as though it might have been undercooked.  Head straight to your dorm rooms.  If you have to-” he paused.  “It is best if you use the wastebins in your room instead of trying to make your way to the toilets.  I expect there will be too much demand.  You will be looked after, but go now before you feel any worse.”
    
    We’ll be looked after?
    
    Jamie was staring intently, still in his seat.  He stirred when I reached across his field of vision for a pitcher of water, only a quarter of the way filled.  I emptied the contents into another pitcher, then slid it across the table to Gordon.
    
    “What’s this?”
    
    “If we can’t get to a wastebin,” I said, “Better the jug than the floor.  You hold onto it?”
    
    Gordon took the glass pitcher by the handle, one arm supporting Helen.  It wasn’t much, but it served as a weapon.
    
    “Go ahead,” I told Jamie.  While he and Lillian circled the table, I emptied another pitcher into the one at the center of the table, holding it in my hands.
    
    Not that it mattered too much.  If it came down to me needing a weapon to defend myself, I doubted things could be salvaged.
    
    Still made me feel better.
    
    We headed for the girl’s dormitory with Helen and a few stragglers.  I was glad to be shorter than the norm, as I ducked my head down and let the crowd shield me from the eyes of the teachers.
    
    I’d hoped that the act of taking care of Helen would let us break away, but there were too many people vacating the dining room.  Even those who were well were being driven out by the aroma of vomit.  It was humid in the room with the heat from the kitchen and the sheer number of students, and the humidity helped carry the offensive odor.  We couldn’t break away from the crowd, and I wasn’t sure that the dorm room would be much better.
    
    Beside me, an older girl hunched over, making a guttural noise.  Everyone near her cleared out of the way.
    
    I took advantage of the gap in the crowd to step closer.  I stuck the empty pitcher beneath her mouth, pulling my head back and away so I didn’t have to look as she emptied a portion of her stomach’s contents.
    
    “Thank you,” she said, still bent over, smiling.
    
    She reached to take the pitcher, and I pulled it away from her grasp.
    
    “Reserved for friends,” I said.
    
    She looked a little bewildered and lost.
    
    “And here I thought you were a gentleman,” Erma mumbled.
    
    “I’m a bastard, born and bred,” I said.  And there’s no way I’m handing a weapon over to a potential enemy.
    
    With students moving slowly and some pushing or jostling, the way up the stairs looked like more of a jam than any day on King Street.  We were probably safe while we were a group, but if the crowd separated us, or if someone tried to slip us the wrong end of a knife while we were in the crush of bodies, I wasn’t sure we’d be able to respond accordingly.
    
    I saw Gordon shooting Jamie a look, and I sensed that he was thinking along the same lines.
    
    We were stuck.
    
    “Where are the showers?” I asked.
    
    “Showers?”
    
    “Baths?  Where do we wash up?”
    
    “Upstairs one floor,” Gordon said, “Above the dining room.”
    
    He took the question as an instruction, and he and Helen dutifully forged their way into a gap in the crowd.  Jamie, Lillian and I hurried to follow, me holding my pitcher off to one side, to avoid the smell.
    
    People were slow, some had stopped on the stairs, sitting or on all fours, and there was a smell that suggested they weren’t all simply throwing up.  It was a mess, a disaster, and a stain on Mothmont on many levels.
    
    That part of it all was almost certainly a clue.
    
    There were a lot of details to be picked out of this.  Motivation, approach, the nature of the enemy…
    
    I idly moved the pitcher to one side, intending it to be a shield against anyone reaching for me or holding a weapon, but it ended up serving another purpose.  The sight of a glass container filled with vomit made two girls shy back.  It was an avenue for me to slip upstairs, skipping ahead three steps, ducking past two students, and stepping to safety, free of the sickly herd.
    
    The others followed me as we headed into the girl’s showers.  Two showers were already running, and the room was filled with steam.  The floor was white tile, the stalls themselves were wood painted with an exceedingly glossy paint.  Each stall was recessed, with hooks and benches before the door and the shower beyond.
    
    “They get individual stalls?” Jamie asked.  “Why do they get individual stalls?”
    
    “Shh,” Gordon shushed him.
    
    Erma had followed us, and staggered past us to the first available stall, where she promptly decorated the floor with her dinner.
    
    I glanced around, then pointed.  While the others led the way, I stepped to nearby stalls and turned on the water.  The hiss of water filled the room.
    
    By the time I caught up with the others in the furthest shower back, Helen was standing upright, her expression blank.  Gordon stood with a foot resting on one of the little benches at the entry to the stall, while Jamie and Lillian occupied the other short bench.
    
    I stood at the entrance to the stall, where I could peek out and keep an eye on the door.  Clouds of steam drifted.
    
    Helen reached past the others for my pitcher, and I let her have it.  Without flinching, she emptied some onto her sleeve.  She turned on the water, cold more than warm, and stepped under the stream.  The water ran over her, soaking her hair and uniform.  The makeup around her eyes ran.
    
    I glanced away, my attention on the other stalls.  Pacing back a bit, I bent down, peering under stalls.  I saw some bare feet and wet socks.  It looked like Erma was sitting on the floor of the shower, letting water run over her.
    
    “Were we followed?” Gordon asked, his voice low.
    
    “Don’t know,” Jamie murmured.
    
    “When things get this messy, it gets harder to keep track of things,” I said.  “Which might be what they’re counting on.”
    
    “Trying to catch us out?” Gordon asked.
    
    I nodded.  “Shaking things up, yeah.  What worries me is Mary.”
    
    “I didn’t have any clue,” Helen said.
    
    “It’s okay,” Lillian said, reassuring.  “It’s not your fault.”
    
    “I’m well aware,” Helen said, turning her blank expression on Lillian.  Anyone else might have sounded irritated, but Helen didn’t sound anything.  “If I had an idea and ignored it, then it would be my fault.”
    
    “I… okay,” Lillian said.
    
    “Who is she?” I asked.  “This Mary?”
    
    “Mary Elizabeth Cobourn,” Helen said.  “Her father isn’t influential.  Accountant to the rich and famous.  It’s why I didn’t pay particular attention to her.”
    
    “Who is her mother?” Gordon asked.
    
    “I don’t know,” Helen said.  “I just looked at the men, because of the prior pattern.  Would have asked, but it’s harder to ask about a girl’s mother.”
    
    I nodded.  Most mothers were teachers, nurses, or homemakers.  Nothing so interesting that we could ask.  There were more women attending the Academy, but few from the last generation.
    
    “Worth looking into,” Gordon said.  He ran his fingers through his golden hair, which was damp with the light spray that had touched it.  “Check the rest of her family, why she might be selected out of all the students here.”
    
    I could sense how stressed the others were.  This maneuver had put us all in a reactionary position, and our options were limited until the other shoe dropped.  I volunteered some information, hoping to get them focused again.  Not necessarily improving morale, but I doubted that was a real issue.  We knew this sort of situation well enough.  “We know she had a role in this.  She might as well have told us to our faces that she was involved, the line about enjoying our meals, the look she gave us.   It means something, if she doesn’t care about us coming after her.”
    
    Jamie nodded.  “The puppeteer is using these students as murder weapons.  As a killer, he has a pattern.  Murder-suicides.  One after another.  The suicides cover up evidence.  If Mary keeps to the pattern, she’s either going to come after us-”
    
    “Or she’s going to go home,” Gordon said.  He paused.  “Oh.”
    
    I followed his thoughts to the same conclusion.  “This is the endgame.”
    
    “I’m sorry,” Lillian cut in.  “I’m not following.”
    
    “They know we’re onto them,” Gordon said.  “Our puppeteer somehow figured out about us.  Maybe through a connection to the Academy, maybe by some other means.  He got scared, and now he’s wrapping up.  Get everyone sick, and in the midst of the chaos he can send his weapons after us, or students are sent home and finish their jobs.”
    
    “Or both,” I said.  “If they’re careful about how they come after us, there’s nothing saying they can’t take a run at us and then disappear.”
    
    “That’s possible,” Gordon agreed.  “Especially if they know who we are, they might not want to pick a fight.”
    
    I heard a noise and glanced past the entrance to the stall to check the door.
    
    Two more students.  One was crying.
    
    I stepped further into the steam and shadow and eyed them until they disappeared into a stall.  No sign of hostility.
    
    “Either way,” Gordon was saying, “our puppeteer may be wary enough to take a break for a few years, let interest in things die down, or pack up and head to another campus at another school.”
    
    “Maybe,” I said.  “This approach here feels ugly.  Making students sick?  Vomit and shit everywhere.”
    
    “Hurts Mothmont where it counts, and what hurts Mothmont hurts the Academy,” Gordon said.
    
    “Personal,” Lillian said.
    
    I nodded.  “Now you’re getting up to speed.”
    
    She looked annoyed at that phrasing.
    
    “We have a man-” Gordon said.
    
    “-Or woman,” Jamie cut in.
    
    Gordon continued as if he hadn’t been interrupted, “-Who considers these children to be expendable assets.  He alters them somehow, gives them a target, and has them die after the fact, tidying up the evidence.  He does this because he hates the school?  That’s an awful lot of hate.  Do we really think he’s a teacher?  That’s a lot of involvement and hours of the day to spend around something you hate that much.”
    
    “Isn’t it possible?” Helen asked.
    
    “No,” Gordon said, frowning a little.  “I really don’t think it is.  It feels too spiteful, twisting the knife for good measure when he could simply stab.”
    
    Helen nodded.
    
    “What if this isn’t about the school?” I asked.
    
    “Go on.”
    
    “It’s personal, but it’s a grudge against a person.”
    
    “Against the headmistress?” Gordon asked.
    
    I offered a languid shrug.  The moisture in the air was starting to collect on my skin and clothes.  I wiped my forehead and pushed my hair back and away from my forehead.  “Jamie?  Any thoughts on the faculty?”
    
    “They were talking as a group before Mr. McCairn did his announcement,” Jamie said.  “The headmistress didn’t have a lot to say.”
    
    “Did students serve the teachers food?”  I asked.
    
    “Yes, right from the kitchen,” Jamie said.  He paused, glancing to the left, “Mary served the three at the end.”
    
    “Making the headmistress look bad by keeping her ineffectual,” I said.  “More poison or whatever it was-”
    
    “Emetics,” Lillian said.  “Maybe laxative.”
    
    “Mary gave the headmistress more emetics than anyone else,” I amended my statement.  “The question is who would have a grudge against-”
    
    I sensed a movement out of the corner of my eye.  My head turned, my hand and one finger going up for the benefit of the others.
    
    “To your rooms, now,” a woman’s voice cut in.
    
    I heard footsteps.  Both those belonging to the woman and the footsteps of the fleeing girls.
    
    A sharp knock, a few stalls down.
    
    “Out,” was the order.
    
    Doing the rounds, clearing everyone away.
    
    Gordon held up his hand, counting off on his fingers, his voice low.  “Who has a grudge against the headmistress?  Someone on campus, who can communicate with the students.  Who is Mary and why her?  Look at who her mother is.  What is the mechanism of control?  And don’t forget that they’re liable to come for us.  Be on guard, and don’t forget they might try to take you out with them.”
    
    “And their families,” Lillian said.  “If they get away…”
    
    “We’ll step in if it looks like there’s any danger of that happening,” Jamie assured her.
    
    “We will,” I agreed.  “I’d bet money this ploy of theirs has another angle.  Watch out for the angle.”
    
    There were nods.
    
    “Out,” the teacher gave the order, several stalls down.
    
    “My friends,” Erma said.  “They were in here.”
    
    Selling us out?
    
    No, Erma didn’t know we were trying to avoid the spotlight.
    
    “Do we need to worry about Erma?” Gordon asked.
    
    “I don’t know,” Helen said.
    
    “Not wanting us in the girl’s dorm was suspicious,” Gordon said, his voice a whisper.
    
    I could hear the teacher’s approaching footsteps, hard soles on tile.
    
    “Oh, that?” Lillian asked.  “Her room’s a sty.  She doesn’t know how to look after herself.”
    
    Our entire group collectively relaxed.
    
    There was a metal-on-metal squeak as another shower was turned off.
    
    I turned to face the woman as she emerged from the steam.
    
    “Boys in the girl’s showers?” she asked, her voice arching, as if she were about to launch into a tirade.
    
    “It’s okay,” Lillian said.  “We-”
    
    “Not another word.  This is most certainly not ‘okay’!” the woman said, building up steam.
    
    Helen stumbled forward, lightly headbutting the woman in the solar plexus.  With wet hands, she clutched the woman by the shirtfront.
    
    “Miss Williams,” Helen mewled the words, “I feel so bad.  Please.  I-”
    
    Helen paused, apparently holding back her gorge.
    
    Gordon stepped forward, hurrying to offer my pitcher of vomit to the woman.  The woman had to fight Helen’s clutches to get to the pitcher and offer it to the girl.
    
    Helen managed to unload a mouthful of vomit and missed the pitcher entirely, dropping it on the floor between the woman’s feet.  She coughed, clutching at the woman’s shirt again.  “It hurts.”
    
    I jumped in.  “We know her, and she had it worse than anyone, and we didn’t know what to do.  There were so many people on the stairs we weren’t sure we could get anywhere in time.”
    
    “She had someone else’s mess on her sleeve,” Lillian said.  “I thought she could clean off, but I couldn’t support her myself, because Erma was there too, so we came here, and she went into the shower like that.”
    
    “I wanted to get cool,” Helen said.  “I feel hot and sweaty and gross and…” her words dissolved into incoherent whines.
    
    “I-” the woman started.
    
    “Please, we don’t want to get in trouble,” Gordon said.  “We didn’t know any way to help her.”
    
    “You don’t-”
    
    “It hurts,” Helen said.  “My stomach is cramping.”
    
    “Enough,” the woman said.  She managed to extricate herself from Helen.  “Enough of that.  You need to act like young adults.  I understand that this young lady is feeling unwell, but that’s no excuse for the rest of you.”
    
    She glanced over us, and we collectively managed to look miserable and pitiful enough to get to her.
    
    She gave me a curious look.  “What happened to you?”
    
    “Scrap, ma’am,” I said.
    
    The woman made a face.  “Boys, to your dorms, right now.  They’re doing headcounts shortly.  I’ll look after Helen here.”
    
    We nodded and hurried to obey.
    
    Once I was at the entrance to the showers, I glanced back.  I could make out Helen with her head resting against the woman’s chest, giving me a sidelong glance, a light smile on her face.
    
    I resisted the urge to smile back.
    
    Had things been different, I might have tried to get myself in trouble.  As nice as it would have been to see how punishment worked here and if it might be used to keep the bad seeds in line, I didn’t want to add more complications to a bad situation.
    
    I was damp but not wet from the ambient moisture of the shower, and I ventured into a hallway that reeked of sick.  The students had been cleared out, but the air would have that bitter taste to it for weeks.
    
    Jamie, Gordon and I all made our way down the hall.
    
    “That was good,” Gordon said.  “Being able to talk, touch base.”
    
    “Yeah,” I said.  “But we’re on our back foot.  We know very little where it counts.  They’ve seized the initiative.  Until we turn things around, we’re going to be responding, not acting.  We don’t have time to waste, if they can just call it quits and go murder mom, dad, and themselves.”
    
    “At which point the Academy can’t keep the situation under wraps,” Gordon said.  “What do you think, Sly?  Want to slip away, see what you can do while you’re staying out of sight?  See if you can turn things around or get the right words to the right ears?”
    
    “If they’re doing headcounts, they’ll wonder where I’m at.  Depending on how things go, that wondering might reach our puppeteer.”
    
    “That’s not a no,” Jamie commented.
    
    I smiled.
    
    “He has at least an idea of who we are,” Gordon said.  “Having you lurking could scare him.”
    
    “Or she has an idea who we are,” Jamie said.  “We could scare her.”
    
    Gordon rolled his eyes.
    
    “I’m just saying.  Most teachers are female.”
    
    “I’m only saying this doesn’t feel like a woman’s work,” Gordon said.  “Women care about kids on a deeper level.”
    
    I thought of Lacey.
    
    Jamie was shaking his head.
    
    “What?”
    
    “Nothing,” Jamie said.  “If I try to argue, you’ll win.  You’ll say something about the poisoner being a woman after all, and you’re faster on the draw than I am, so okay.  I forfeit the argument.  You’re right.”
    
    Gordon frowned, clearly annoyed.
    
    “Either way, I’m thinking we don’t want to scare him.  Or her,” I said, adding that last bit for Jamie’s benefit.  I saw a slight smile on Jamie’s face at that, and a slight deepening of Gordon’s frown of annoyance, which was even better.  “If we assume our puppeteer is operating under fear right now, tying everything up and attempting to remove us before we can uncover him, or packing up and running, then we don’t want to push him too far.”
    
    Gordon nodded.
    
    “How do we seize the initiative if you’re worried-” Jamie started.
    
    I reached up, shushing him.
    
    We’d approached a corner, and the man in the red jacket was further down the hallway.  He wasn’t moving, slumped against the wall.
    
    “You think you need me?” Gordon asked.
    
    As if in response, the man in the red jacket passed gas.  It was a long, high pitched sound.
    
    He sighed in audible relief, patted his rear end with his hand, checking, then pulled himself away from the wall.
    
    I took a second to admire the man’s courage before saying, “I don’t think so.”
    
    Gordon nodded, but he didn’t move from the base of the stairwell while Jamie and I headed toward our room.
    
    “Hello, Mr. McCairn,” Jamie greeted the man.
    
    “Jamie.  And… I don’t recognize this one.”
    
    “Sylvester,” I said.
    
    “To your rooms, stat.  I’m doing a headcount as we speak.”
    
    You’re standing there suffering, or you’re acting, but you’re most definitely not in the midst of doing anything else, I thought.
    
    Still, I obeyed.
    
    I closed the door, then immediately began studying our surroundings.  Jamie sat on his bed.
    
    “You were saying?” he asked.
    
    “We head back to our room, and you tell me about the faculty.”
    
    Jamie nodded.  “Where do I start?”
    
    “Headmistress.”
    
    “Not a lot to say.  She was a teacher for five years before her superior came down with a pregnancy, she took over, and she did a good enough job that she kept the job while moving from place to place.  When Mothmont sprung up, they went looking for someone with a squeaky reputation and clean face to watch over it all.”
    
    Squeaky reputation.  That didn’t mean it was a clean reputation, but it changed the tone of things.  Was it ambition at the heart of it?
    
    I nodded.  I searched the room, looking over the desk, opening the drawers.
    
    Nothing of particular interest.  Ink bottles, pens, a kit for sewing, in case we needed to mend our uniforms…
    
    I removed the contents of the drawers, setting the items on top of the desk.  I considered them.
    
    “McCairn?”  I asked Jamie, when I was done considering.
    
    “Ex-military.  Does drills with the boys, looks over the boy’s dorm.”
    
    “Physical education?”
    
    Jamie nodded.
    
    “It’s all an act,” I said.
    
    “Is it?”
    
    “Yes.  Dressing up, playing up the accent.  They picked him because he was local, not because he was upper crust.”
    
    “Do you think he’s a consideration?  If he’s picking off the powerful, maybe he doesn’t like being the low man on the totem pole?”
    
    “I’m more likely to think he’s beholden to this place than an outright enemy.  Besides, how does he control the children?  Who else?  Second person at the table, between McCairn and the headmistress.  Academy-trained?”
    
    I turned my attention to the chests at the foot of our beds.  I opened the lid, and then tested the weight of the lid itself.
    
    Solid wood, three feet by two feet, give or take.
    
    “Not Academy trained, no.”
    
    Returning to the desk, I claimed a pen, then set to unscrewing the hinges from the bottom portion of the chest.  “Who is he?”
    
    “Mr. Percy.  He teaches the younger years.  Fundamentals of Academy science.”
    
    “But he’s not Academy trained?”
    
    “Teaches it from the books.”
    
    I pulled the lid free of the chest itself, hinges dangling.  I set it aside.  “Help.”
    
    Jamie was on his feet.  Not a question as to why.  He just obeyed.
    
    Together, we moved the chest to the base of the door.  The entire thing must have weighed six or so stone.  A piece of furniture unto itself.
    
    I upended the chest, so the side was facing up, and then dragged the lid over.  I climbed up onto the chest so my eyes were level with the top of the door, and the two of us managed to raise the chest’s lid up to the same level, resting the end of the lid near where my toes were.
    
    “Get the chair?” I asked.  “And a book or something.”
    
    He did.  Standing on the chair, he had a little less height than I did, but he was able to help me, lifting the lid higher.  When it got too high for Jamie to really help, he used the book for extra leverage, while I used my other hand to steady it.
    
    In the process, we managed to get the entire thing up so it rested on the top of the doorframe, flush against the wall.
    
    With one hand up to keep it from falling down on top of us, I took the book from Jamie and adjusted the bend of the hinge, until it bent at a right angle.
    
    I opened the door a crack, peered through to make sure the hallway was empty, then gave the hinge a solid whack with the book.
    
    The hinge punched into the wall.
    
    Tentatively, I let go.
    
    “You have the oddest sense for decorations,” Jamie said.
    
    “I left the screws on the corner of the bed.”
    
    “Ah, sure.”  Jamie went to fetch the screws.
    
    “If he’s had access to the books, he could know something.  Percy.”
    
    “He could,” Jamie agreed.  “But if he was this good, why wouldn’t he be employed by the Academy already?  He’d rather be headmaster?  It’s weak.”
    
    I nodded.  Taking the first screw from Jamie, I used the pen to set it in place, just enough to be firmly in the wood, still sticking out.
    
    “Strangest sense for decoration,” Jamie observed.
    
    “Shut up, and give me a screw,” I said.
    
    Jamie obliged.
    
    It took only a minute to get the screws into place.  Set randomly, as my reach allowed.
    
    “Sewing kit?” Jamie asked.
    
    “Yeah,” I said.  “And while I work with that, unlace your shoes.”
    
    “You’re aware this is going to make a racket when it comes down?” Jamie asked.
    
    “I’m aware,” I said.  “But Gordon was right.  It makes sense for me to be out and about… except I don’t like leaving you defenseless.”
    
    “I’m better in a brawl than you are.”
    
    I frowned.  “Don’t say that.”
    
    “It’s true.”
    
    “It’s depressing, because you still suck at it,” I said.  “My worry is that they won’t give you a chance to scrap with them.  If the situation calls for it, this will at least give them pause.”
    
    I put the first pin’s point against the wood, then pressed the cover of the book against it until it stuck out.  I started with the second pin.
    
    “Laces done.”
    
    “Both shoes?”
    
    “Yeah,” he said.  He handed them to me.
    
    “Lie down, get a wink or two,” I said.  “I’ll wait around until they’re done the headcount, then I’ll disappear.  You leave me a signal if it’s unsafe for me to return?”
    
    Jamie nodded.
    
    ☙
    
    No plan went a hundred percent smoothly.
    
    Sitting in the dark of the room, I could feel the lingering headache from my appointment.  The lights were off, the building was almost silent, but for the sounds of people continuing to be ill.  There was nothing to distract me from my own pain.
    
    The shoelaces hung limp in my hand.  With my own shoelaces attached, they strung up to the board I’d fixed above the wall.  It bristled with collected screws, needles, broken pen tips, and a few choice pieces of glass.
    
    The limited length of the shoelaces had meant I’d had to sit on the corner of Jamie’s bed or the chair, and even though sitting on the bed meant getting periodically kicked as Jamie tossed and turned under his covers, it was far more comfortable than the hard wooden chair.
    
    I didn’t mind the company, even if the company was asleep.
    
    My trap here wouldn’t kill, but killing wasn’t the aim.
    
    Couldn’t interrogate the dead.
    
    Every few minutes, I’d hear someone being sick or crying out, the rustle of running footsteps, or smell rank aromas from nearby rooms.
    
    The trick was to connect the sounds.  I drew a mental picture, tying it all together, sequences of events.
    
    It was when I heard a murmured conversation and the rustle of footsteps without any sound of distress to precede it that I tensed.
    
    Young voices.
    
    Moving the shoelaces to one hand, I slid back reaching as far as I could, and put my fingers over Jamie’s mouth.
    
    He was awake in an instant.  I felt his hot breath between my fingers.
    
    He nodded.
    
    Floorboards creaked.  The doorknob rattled.
    
    The light from the corridor outside was blinding as the door yawned open.
    
    “Hey,” Ed said.  I could only barely make out his smile.  “You’re up.”
    
    My eyes widened.
    
    Three people.  Ed and his buds.  Boys who hadn’t sat at the table with me, Gordon, and the rest of us.
    
    They’d collected their food around the same time Gordon had, as part of Gordon’s pack, even if they weren’t feeling too kindly toward my orphan brother.
    
    I considered all the options, then sighed.
    
    “Ed,” I said, “You don’t know the sort of mess you’re getting yourself stuck into.”
    
    He approached me, and I felt a kind of resignation as I let the shoelace slip from my slack fingers.
    
    “Sy,” Jamie said.
    
    “Shut it,” Ed said.  “Stay put, don’t make a fuss.  Our business is with Sy.”
    
    “Right,” Jamie said.  “Yeah.”
    
    “What’s Gordon going to think?” I asked.  But it wasn’t really an ask.  More a statement, to Jamie.
    
    “Gordon’s got his head up his ass,” Ed said.  “Now keep your voice down.  Don’t bother calling for help.  We’ve got someone keeping McCairn busy upstairs.”
    
    I bet, I thought.
    
    He grabbed me, and he hauled me up.  I didn’t try putting up a fight.  It would have been useless, and I hoped they’d get sloppy and give me a chance to surprise them.
    
    With his buddies, he marched me forward, glancing this way, then that, before forcing me over toward the stairs.
    
    We were half a flight down before I heard Jamie’s running footsteps above, going up to talk to Gordon.
    
    I hoped to hell they’d be able to find me in time.
    
    “You don’t know what you’re doing,” I said.
    
    “I know well enough.  You’re an ass, Sylvester, and you made enemies.  Now it’s catching up with you.”
    
    I decided to keep my mouth shut.
    
    The descent continued until we reached the first floor, then continued down another flight.
    
    Once we were at the bottom, I could feel the heat in the air.  The area was barely lit, the lighting buzzing audibly, flickering now and again, threatening to plunge us into darkness.
    
    The boys opened a door.
    
    There were no lightbulbs, but a very large furnace blazed, casting irregular orange flames throughout the room, while leaving much of the rest in darkness.
    
    “Mary,” I guessed.
    
    “Got it in one,” she said, from the gloom.
    
    I nodded slowly.  “You’ve been paying a lot of attention to me.”
    
    “I’ve been paying enough,” she said.
    
    She leaned forward.  The light from the fire flickered over her face.
    
    “What’d you tell them?” I asked.  I jerked my head to one side.
    
    “The truth.  That you insulted me.  A bigger boy beating you up, you can use that.  Get pity from girls, from my friends.  But if a girl beat you up?  You’d never live it down.”
    
    “The truth, huh?” I asked.
    
    “Do you disagree with my version of events?”
    
    I considered.
    
    I sighed.  “No, I suppose not.”
    
    Not if it meant that she’d clean up Ed and his cronies while dealing with me.
    
    “Because I really wondered if you were that type of person.  If you were that much of a scoundrel.”
    
    I shrugged.  “I’m not denying that I’m a scoundrel.  I do have to wonder what you are.”
    
    “That, Sylvester, would be telling,” Mary said.
    
    “Are you going to start fighting yet?” Ed asked.  “The little ass gets a whupping from me, and goes straight back to cozying up to your friends, disrespecting them, disrespecting you.  I want to hear a proper apology from his lips.”
    
    “I’m not really the apology type,” I said.
    
    “That!”  Ed said, “Right there.  I want you to make it so I never have to hear him say anything like that ever again.”
    
    “Not until you’re gone,” Mary said.
    
    “Huh?  I want to see.”
    
    “A girl has her modesty,” Mary said.
    
    “That’s bull,” Ed said.  “We went out after curfew and brought him here.”
    
    “I’ll make you a bet,” Mary said.  “If he turns up at school tomorrow, I’ll give you my company for an entire day.  We can go out on the town over the weekend.”
    
    “She’s leaving school tomorrow,” I said.
    
    “The trouble with being a little grease-stain, Sylvester, is that your words lose their power.  Anything you say comes out sounding like a lie.”
    
    “You really have been paying attention,” I said.
    
    “One day for each of us,” Ed said.
    
    “One day for each of you, or he’s so embarrassed he never turns up again,” Mary said, her voice soft.  “Win-win.”
    
    “Sure,” Ed said.
    
    “Do me a favor, though?”
    
    “Hm?”
    
    “His friends are probably hunting for him.  There’s a stash of cards and dirty books in the kitchen, behind the shelves by the stove.  Duck over there, hang out for a while before going back to your room.”
    
    “For real?” Ed asked.
    
    “For real.  I’ve seen the cook boys goggling over it.”
    
    I hung my head.
    
    Ed’s group wasted no time.  I could hear the door shut behind me.
    
    “You’re good,” I said.
    
    I heard a click.
    
    I recognized it as the sound of a gun lever.
    
    “You’re very good,” I said, raising my arms.
    
    “I saw your showing against Ed.  There’s no way you’re that bad in a scrap.  It’s a show.”
    
    “It really isn’t,” I said.
    
    “I’m going to assume you’re lying and stay comfortably at a safe distance,” she said.  “You’re going to tell me about your friends.  Share what you know.  In exchange, I’ll be merciful.”
    
    “Merciful?”
    
    “I’ll shoot you properly, once in the head, once in the chest.  Then I haul you over and push you into the furnace before taking my leave.”
    
    “The alternative being?”
    
    “I take your legs out from under you, then hold you up to slow cook you while you’re alive.”
    
    My eyes were adjusting to the gloom.  I could see the look in her eyes.
    
    She totally would.
    
    I exhaled slowly.  “Okay.”
    
    “Good boy.”"""
    
    taking_root.append(taking_root_6)
    
    taking_root_7 = """Taking Root one point seven. “Catch,” Mary said.
    
    Something flew at me.  I couldn’t see it in the darkness, and it bounced off the door by my head.
    
    I figured out where it had bounced off to and collected it.  I felt it rather than looking at it.  A key.
    
    “Without turning around, lock the door.  If it opens or if you try anything funny, I shoot.”
    
    I did as instructed.
    
    “That was a little too fast,” she said.  “Stand with your back to the door.  Try the knob.”
    
    I did.  I turned the knob to the side, tugged on the door, turned the knob all the way to the other side, and then tugged on it again.  The door rattled against the frame.
    
    “I stand corrected,” she said.  “Toss me the key.”
    
    I did.
    
    Unlike me, she did manage to catch it, but she had the benefit of the light from the furnace.  She held it up to the light, examining it.
    
    While she wasn’t looking directly at me, I glanced around the room.  There was a workbench with tools on the far end of the room, and she sat on the corner of it, legs dangling and not reaching the ground.  She wasn’t wearing her uniform, but a sweater, cloak and hood, and a skirt with stockings and boots.  The gun was in her lap, pointed at me, and other weapons sat within arm’s reach.  A hatchet, hammer, and the knife she probably planned to use if it came down to it.
    
    By contrast, there was nothing of substance near me.  I was uncomfortably close to the furnace, but the door didn’t quite face me, so I got the heat without the benefit of the light that streaked across the room in lines.  The space around the furnace was kept clear, so fire wouldn’t catch.  A coal-operated monstrosity of a thing.  There was a pile of the fuel in the corner, a sliding door on the chute where the coal was deposited.
    
    We’d voiced our suspicions aloud, that they would strike at us and then disappear to finish their missions.  I had a sense of what her escape route was.
    
    I started to slide to the floor.
    
    “What are you doing?” she asked.  “Stop.”
    
    I stopped halfway, legs bent, back flat against the door.
    
    “I was sitting down,” I said.
    
    “I don’t trust anything you do.  Certainly not this,” she told me.  The way she phrased certainly was good.  Very proper, enunciated like a girl raised by the best teachers.
    
    “You’ve made it clear that I’m going to die,” I said, holding my position.  “I didn’t expect it this soon, but I’ve always figured it was going to happen.  If there’s a chance I get to die sitting down, just after an interesting conversation, I consider it a pretty good end.”
    
    She moved her head, and the light from the fire danced across her face with the motion.  “This isn’t a conversation.  It’s an interrogation.”
    
    “Now I’m the one who stands corrected.”
    
    I thought I saw her expression change.  A frown.
    
    Had she caught me mirroring her?  Was she aware of what mirroring was?
    
    “May I sit?” I asked.
    
    “Feet apart, hands where I can see them,” she said.
    
    I obeyed on both fronts, but I didn’t drop to the floor.  “But can I sit?”
    
    “That was implied.  With your back to the door, please.”
    
    “Implications are dangerous when you have a pistol pointed at you,” I said.  I slid the rest of the way down, keeping my hands up.  I rested my wrists on my knees, palms toward her, fingers spread.
    
    I took a second, rolling my shoulders.
    
    She didn’t say or do anything.  She remained in the shadows.
    
    “I’m stiff,” I commented.  “I just spent three hours or so sitting on the end of a bed.  I had a trap rigged, was going to pull it down on top of anyone who came in through the door.  Except it turned out to be Ed.”
    
    “He was in one piece,” Mary observed.
    
    “For the same reason I didn’t tell him what you really were.  Doesn’t serve a point, only gets him killed.  If it works somehow, I’m still up shit creek.  Cat out of the bag.”
    
    “You’re very calm, Sylvester,” Mary said.  A sudden change of subject.  “Why is that?”
    
    “Like I said, I’m not too surprised I might die.  You know, about a week ago-”
    
    “No stalling for time,” she told me.
    
    “It’s relevant, I promise,” I said.  Several seconds passed without a word from her.  I started up again, “About a week ago, Professor Hayle from the Academy’s neurology department gave me a ride to the Academy.  Do you know why?”
    
    “Keep going, Sylvester,” she said.  “Don’t ask me questions to try and squeeze details from me.”
    
    “If you were really merciful, you’d tell me.  It’s a kind of torture, making me go to my grave without all of the answers.”
    
    “I’m only offering mercy because it’s the only thing I’m willing to give you in exchange for information,” Mary told me.  “You were saying?”
    
    I sighed.
    
    “I was hurt.  I got myself hurt on purpose, contrived to be in Professor Hayle’s coach and get him out of the coach, so I could take a peek at his files.  On me, on Gordon, on Helen, Jamie, Lillian, and Evette.”
    
    Nothing in her expression or body language changed.
    
    Was she ignorant?  Did she not know that that wasn’t the real composition of the group?  They didn’t have particulars?  Or was she very good at hiding her tells?
    
    I had to assume she was competent, and couldn’t push my luck without getting a bullet in the leg for my trouble.
    
    “It was a lot of trouble, but there was a reason I went that far.  I needed to find out what they weren’t telling us.  I wanted to find out how long they expected us to last.”
    
    “Last?”
    
    “In terms of life expectancy.  Or project expectancy.  There’s more glory in breaking new ground than there is in refining someone else’s work, and the entire setup of the Academy is all about innovation more than doing good work.  We’re a casualty of that.”
    
    “You and the others,” Mary said.
    
    “We, Mary,” I said.  I angled my head down until the angle of the light from the fire was enough to be especially bright in my eyes.  I couldn’t see Mary as well, but I knew that she’d see the reflection.  “You too.”
    
    “We’re not talking about me,” she said.  “Go on.”
    
    I moved my head back, shrugging.  “Most of us weren’t going to live to see twenty.  Barring outside intervention.”
    
    My hands moved to indicate her, the outside intervention in question.
    
    “My concern isn’t with your life expectancy.  I know exactly when you’re going to die.”
    
    “I haven’t even told the others the numbers,” I said.  “Promised Gordon I would fill him in later, but the opportunity never came up.  How do you tell someone-”
    
    “Sylvester,” Mary said, unamused.
    
    “Okay.  Okay.  New projects.  You know how the departments portioned out cash for various measures?  We got funding as a special project.  Got it better than some.  Six individual cases, each managed with an entirely different approach.  If you want to know what you’re up against, that’s it.  I don’t like Professor Hayle, but he gave us money, and he tried for the gamble.  Longer-term approach than some of the other special projects, and with less than twenty years before most of us expire, that’s saying something.”
    
    “Details.”
    
    I shrugged.  “There are some big names on the other projects.  Do you know Doctor Ibott?  Of course you know Ibott.”
    
    “Details about you, and your group.  Please don’t test me, Sylvester.”
    
    “Hayle has been fighting to keep his department afloat, while others get regular injections of cash to keep innovating.  He gets a lot of criticism because in this age of innovation and immediate results, we’re taking too long to show anything demonstrable.  Their word, demonstrable.  If you pronounce it right, you could fit ‘monster’ in there.”
    
    I smiled, while Mary didn’t look amused in the slightest.
    
    “We’re meant to develop into something monstrous over time.  Most of us.  Each member of the group with a role, a defined identity, and a specific set of skills, crafted using entirely different means.  What you’re dealing with… we’re good, but we’re not there yet.”
    
    “Defined identities,” Mary echoed me.  “You called yourself a villain, back in the dining room.”
    
    “I’m the black sheep, or the black lamb, Mary.  Gordon is the multi-talented hero, Helen the actress, Jamie the bookworm and record keeper, Evette is the problem solver who steps out from the background to deliver answer and solution in one fell stroke, and Lillian is a student on the verge of becoming the teacher, eventually to become master, surpassing professors in her mastery of the Academy science.  Me?  I’m only the bastard.”
    
    Were the sharp contrasts between light and shadow playing tricks on my eyes, or had Mary’s expression changed?
    
    Sorry, Evette.  I hope it’s some consolation that you’re here with us in this sense, if nothing else.  A phantom enemy they have no details on.
    
    “It was smart of you to come after me first.  Go for the weak link.  That’s a good instinct you have.”
    
    “Something tells me you aren’t a weak link, Sylvester.”
    
    I shrugged.  “We’re opposites, aren’t we?”
    
    “Opposites?”
    
    “I’m supposed to cover the gaps for the others.  You… you’re very specialized.  You were prepared for one task.  Anything else is peripheral.  I’m built to be part of a composite whole.  You… you’ve got the boys, but you don’t have them.  There’s no support.  You’re among kindred but you’re alone.”
    
    My eyes were adjusting to the gloom.  I could see how she wasn’t moving.  Both hands held the pistol.
    
    She didn’t move a hair.  Only the licks of fire from the furnace illuminated anything.
    
    “You don’t know me,” she said.
    
    This far into our dialogue, I had a sense of her.  Before, I might have had to guess.  Now I was suspicious that this was a willful lack of movement.  She was trying very hard not to give me anything.
    
    I shrugged.  “I know more than you think.  You don’t trust your… should I call them fellow experiments?”
    
    “I think you’re taking your own experiences and transplanting your experiences onto me.”
    
    “Do you?  If you think I don’t trust the others with my life, you couldn’t be more wrong,” I said.  I clenched my hands, kneading the upper palms with my fingers to crack them, knowing full well that she was on the alert, that it would distract and force her to divide her focus between watching and listening.  “You, on the other hand, are paranoid.  Exceedingly careful.  Locking the door, taking the extra measures you are, keeping more than enough weapons in arm’s reach.  You made the boys a part of your plan, but you don’t trust them to have your back.”
    
    “You keep saying that.  ‘The boys’.  I know you’re trying to make me let something slip.  Keep trying and-”
    
    “Bull,” I cut her off.  “You want to know how we operate?  This is part of it.  Every single thing you do, even this?  We can use it.  We can pick it apart and unravel it.  Every action you take, you tip your hand in one way or another.  There’s no other girl.  The boys were a group.  Ed said they were distracting whoever was walking the halls.  They, plural.”
    
    “Ed’s friends, you mean?”
    
    I shook my head.  “Ed and his closest buddies didn’t sit with us at dinner.  The rest like Gordon enough they wouldn’t pull something like that.  It was your fellow experiments.  The boys.  They operate as a group.  But while they shared the task of distracting the man, you have nobody else with you.  Dealing with unknown quantities, you could have had another girl there with you, standing in the shadow, ready to use the same escape route.”
    
    I gestured toward the closed chute beside her.
    
    “You showed yourself, acting the individual, taking point.  You showed off while doing it, that line about enjoying our meals.  That tells me you did it voluntarily, to stand out.  There’s no other girl in this narrative.  You stand alone, Mary Elizabeth Coburn, and you know it.”
    
    She looked down at the gun.  “I feel like shooting you now.”
    
    “That reminds me, just in case you feel like shooting me all of a sudden.  When you do it, can you do me a favor?  Shoot me in the heart?”
    
    She looked up at me.
    
    “I always thought my head would be what went first.  I’d kind of like to stick it to fate.”
    
    “Not knowing what you are, I’m not sure I’m willing to risk it.  For all I know, you’re a human they grew in a jar.”
    
    “I’m real.  Woman-born,” I said.  “An adjustment made after the fact, so my head works in a slightly different way.  A shot to the heart will kill me.  But maybe one to the heart, watch me die, then finish me off with one to the head?  As one experiment to another, it would be very much appreciated.”
    
    “You’re a fatalistic little shit, aren’t you?  That’s really not an act, huh?”
    
    “I said we were opposites, before.  Even our positions here make for a pretty good contrast.  You up high, armed to the teeth.  Me down below.  Roasting.  My weakness is my head.  Yours-”
    
    “It strikes me,” she said, interrupting me, affecting an arch tone of surprise, “that I’m sitting here, and it truly feels like I’m the one being interrogated.  For the past minute or two we’ve barely talked about you in any meaningful capacity.”
    
    That was the kind of epiphany that was punctuated by the pull of a trigger.
    
    I’d hoped to lead into it more, but…
    
    “If I were him, I would have told you that you were special,” I said.
    
    She didn’t pull the trigger.
    
    “You don’t have to say anything,” I said.  I even dropped my head down to look at the floor, so she didn’t have to worry about me studying her in the darkness.  “I’m just going to talk out loud.  You’re alone.  You’re smart enough and you have free reign enough that you have to know what happened to your predecessors.  Word gets around a school like this, and you’ve shown you can connect the dots.”
    
    I continued, “That leaves a question.  How does he keep you in line?  How does he convince you that you’re safe, that you won’t go the same way the others did?  My line of thinking is that he tells you that out of all the tries, you worked.  This on top of whatever story he’s concocted, that he’s equipped you to kill your parents and that nobody will suspect you, the orphan.  You’ll get the inheritance and everything ends happily ever after.”
    
    Still no bullet.
    
    “You believed him.  You still do, because you have no other choice but to face the grim reality.  That your lifespan is measured in hours.  He tells you to do what you can to deal with us, as discreetly as possible, and then go deal with your parents.  The emetics would be his idea, but this thing with getting me in this room and having the furnace going, it’s all very well done, you put effort into it.  You’ll put effort into dealing with your parents…”
    
    I paused.
    
    You put the effort in because you think he’ll praise you.  You’ll be his triumph.  His girl.  You love him, as a parental figure or as anyone at the start of their journey to adulthood can be infatuated with an adult.
    
    We’re opposites in that respect too.  You love your creator.
    
    “…And you’ll end up exactly like the others, unable to move while the family home burns up around you,” I said, instead.  Attacking her relationship with the puppeteer would get me shot.  I raised my head to look at her.  I couldn’t quite make out her face in the gloom.  “How does he do it, Mary?”
    
    “I thought I didn’t have to say anything,” she said.
    
    Her words were empty of inflection, like Helen’s sometimes was.
    
    I got it wrong?
    
    “I’m trying to help you, you stupid little twit!” I said, clenching my hands again.  “He did something to make you sharper, to put ideas in your head, so that you’d walk the path he drew out in front of you.  I want to know so I can stop you from walking off the cliff that’s waiting at the end!”
    
    “You seem to be forgetting something, Sylvester,” she said.  She hopped down from the edge of the workbench, and used a free hand to smooth out her dress and fix her cloak at the shoulder, the pistol never leaving me.  “Did you think that if you kept saying ‘oh, I’m going to die, I’m going to die, you’re going to kill me’ like it didn’t matter, getting me to let my guard down, that you could turn it around?  Start talking like I’m going to let you live and change my mind on that level?”
    
    “No, actually, you’re quite wrong on that count,” I said.  “I really didn’t.  But it’s really kind of telling that you thought that.  Did you get that idea from him?  Is that how he thinks, and the sort of thing he pays attention to?”
    
    She shook her head.
    
    But it wasn’t a shake of negation.
    
    Mary was losing her faith.  If there was anything I could do to keep her from stepping closer to me and pulling that trigger, it was giving her something to hold on to.
    
    “You’re right that I’ve been interrogating you.  Thinking aloud and watching your reactions.  I can tell that you care about him, and you wanted to do this, right here, for him.  I can give you what you want.”
    
    I can tell that you care about him.  If she was human at her core, finally having a confidant for feelings that had been under lock and key had to count for something.
    
    “A bullet in your head?  A clean disposal?” she asked.  “A job well done?”
    
    “I won’t tell you where Evette is.  But I can tell you who to watch out for.  You can tell him, and he’ll be pleased.  With you.”
    
    She switched to a two-handed grip, aiming at my chest.
    
    All show.
    
    No way she’d shoot, now.
    
    I decided to push my luck further.  “I have a condition.”
    
    She let out a titter of a laugh.  Cultured through and through.
    
    “Don’t go home.  Don’t go visit your parents.  If I’m right, then you’ll find that all the work the puppeteer has done has made it automatic.  You’ll see their faces and all at once you’ll be like a stitched, going through the motions with a very limited capacity, but all of the sharpness the puppeteer gave you.  Execute mom, execute dad, and then burn up yourself with all the rest of the evidence.  If I’m wrong, you lose nothing.  You can take the information I gave you, you can communicate the details to the puppeteer, get a rare compliment that means ever so much to you, and then go kill your parents another day.”
    
    “Delaying gives you a window of opportunity to act against us.  If I communicate with him, that’s a chance for you to identify him.  I’m not that easily manipulated.”
    
    “No you aren’t,” I agreed.  “But you’re wrong about my motivations.  Years ago, back at the beginning of my becoming Sylvester, I stole my file.  I found out about the expiration dates.  That it was so common a thing that it’s a pre-typed line in the documents that go with being an experiment.  I decided that I’d dedicate myself to helping the others.  If I can keep them alive longer, or support them, I’ll do that.  But I think my best bet is to prove that Professor Hayle’s secret project was a success.  Because then they’ll want to keep us alive, they’ll dedicate more to us.”
    
    “What does that have to do with this?”
    
    “You’re similar to the others.  To me, as much as I talk about us being opposites.  I want to keep you alive because you’re kindred.  Not kin, but a bird of the same feather.  Your success is our success, even if we’re on opposite sides.  Even the puppeteer’s success is, in a way.”
    
    “I’m starting to regret letting you talk at all.”
    
    “Because I hit the mark?” I asked, hopeful.
    
    “Because that’s the biggest load of goatshit I’ve ever heard,” she said.
    
    With the back of my head against the door, I could hear the sound of footsteps.  Heavier, running.
    
    No! I thought, even as I kept my expression still.
    
    Not now, I thought.  You damn idiot.  You’ll force her hand and get me shot.
    
    The footsteps receded.  Going the wrong direction.  I resisted the urge to sigh in relief.
    
    I was now forced to rush it.  I couldn’t keep stringing her along, offering her bait to keep her from pulling the trigger.
    
    “Gordon is the one you should watch out for.  Investigating?  He’s still learning.  Acting, disguise, infiltration?  He’s okay at the third, in terms of sheer agility and ability to get places, but the rest are points he needs to shore up.  But when they figure out who the puppeteer is, and they just about have, it’s Gordon who will handle the man.  You can tell the puppeteer that.”
    
    “Assuming I tell him anything.”
    
    You have to, I thought.  Evette is too dangerous as an unknown.
    
    “Assuming you tell him anything, yeah,” I agreed.
    
    The footsteps resumed.  There was a murmur of voice.
    
    Gordon was too fast, and the others were at the bottom of the stairs.
    
    For gods sake, at least be quiet.
    
    I heard a statement, quick and quieter than the ones prior.  Then silence.
    
    They’d seen the light from the furnace under the door, or they’d heard something.
    
    Now they were coming.
    
    “Do what you have to,” I said.  “But know that whatever you do, the moment you go home to fulfill your last order, you’ll be a statistic to the puppeteer, and nothing more.  You’ll revert to the instructions he gave you, and in the midst of it, you’ll be completely and utterly alone.”
    
    The expression in her face went cold.  Angry.  A killer’s eyes.  I believed her, that she didn’t have an iota of mercy in her when it really came down to it.  Her world had been reduced to her and her creator.
    
    “In the meantime, Mary, keep in mind that there are others like you out there.  Including me, at least until you pull that trigger.”
    
    The best way to lie was to believe the lie.  Not that I was lying, but the idea connected to the next.
    
    The best way to surprise someone was to be surprised as well.
    
    The door smashed into the room with a force that sent me from my seat at its base to the center of the room.
    
    Gordon pushed aside the remnants of the door.  It looked as though he’d dislocated his shoulder, from the way he held his arm.
    
    Mary, holding the gun, seemed momentarily caught between finishing me off while I lay two feet from her and dealing with the boy that was half-again her size and apparently capable of throwing himself through a door.
    
    She decided in the same instant Gordon moved.  The pistol wheeled on him, and he threw himself between the wall and the furnace.  The bullet flashed where it hit the edge of the furnace.
    
    She spent five shots in total, and then aimed at me.  I covered my face.
    
    I heard the bullet, but didn’t feel it.
    
    She reached to the table to seize the hatchet, and moved toward me.
    
    Taking me hostage with a hatchet?  She was careful enough to sharpen it.
    
    That would be ideal, but the others wouldn’t let her do it.  There were benefits to acting alone, I supposed.
    
    Instead, I pointed at Gordon.
    
    He was already emerging from behind the furnace.  She heaved the weapon at him, an expert motion, sending handle spinning over axehead.  He ducked back behind the furnace for cover, while the axe struck the wall right where his head had been.
    
    She leaped over my legs on her way to the coal chute, throwing the door open.
    
    Gordon moved to follow.
    
    I heard a rasp.
    
    “Nope!” I called out.  Non-sequitur, but it was what my brain produced in the moment.
    
    Gordon paused.
    
    Fire appeared within the chute.
    
    Our golden boy kicked the chute door closed before the fire could touch the pile of coal at the chute’s base.
    
    Leaving Mary to make her well-planned escape.
    
    I let my head sink back to rest against the floor.  Above me, at the doorway, I could see the others standing on either side of the door, peering into the room.
    
    “What did you get from her?” Helen asked.
    
    “How are you doing, Sy?” I asked, injecting plenty of sarcasm into my voice, “How did you do it, Sy?  Are you okay?”
    
    “Are you okay?” she asked.
    
    “Yes.”
    
    “What did you get from her?” she asked, again.
    
    I sighed.
    
    Gordon offered me a hand in getting to my feet.
    
    “I think she’s vat grown,” I said.  “When pressed, the first thing that popped into her head was a person grown in a bottle.  That’s where I’d lay my money.”
    
    “Vat grown?” Gordon asked.  “Made from scratch?  No, that would be next to impossible, if they’re supposed to resemble the kids they ended up replacing.”
    
    I nodded.  “Clones.  Possibly with implanted behaviors.  Probably something plugged in for imprinting to their creator and a reversal of the typical love for your parents.”
    
    “We can work with that as a starting point,” Jamie said.
    
    “We have a lot to work with,” I said, looking down at the mark the bullet had made in the floor when she’d fired at me.
    
    Too far away to be anything but a deliberate miss."""
    
    taking_root.append(taking_root_7)
    
    taking_root_8 = """Taking Root one point eight. “You’re bleeding,” Lillian noted, touching my chin.
    
    “Someone shoved a door into me,” I said, glancing back at Gordon.
    
    “You’re welcome,” Gordon said.
    
    “Thank you,” I said.  “I appreciate the rescue.  The sentiment, anyway.”
    
    Now it was his turn to shoot me a look.  I was going to say something, but Lillian grabbed my chin, lifting it up.  She patted at it with a pad that smelled like something burnt.
    
    “We almost missed you,” Jamie said.  “We went to the yard, then we were going to split up from there.  I didn’t think you’d be straight down from the dorm room.”
    
    “I saw the smoke at the chimney,” Gordon said.  “I thought it was the kitchen, but Jamie knew the layout better than I did, and we found our way down here.”
    
    “Good as my memory might be, I’m not in top form when I’ve just woken up.  We went to the wrong end of the hall.  There are multiple furnaces for different sections of the building.”
    
    Slow to get things moving, I thought.
    
    “I feel terrible I almost fucked up,” Jamie said.  “It would have been better to follow you first, then gone to get Gordon.”
    
    “They would have seen you and adjusted the plan,” I said.  “This would have gone worse if it was the two of us instead of just me.”
    
    “How’s that?” Gordon asked.
    
    “She could have hurt Jamie to pressure me, or done it the other way around.  Being alone, I could build a rapport.”
    
    “You could have gotten shot,” Jamie said.
    
    “When push came to shove, she missed.  I think there was a reason she missed.”
    
    “More than her being pressed for time?” Jamie asked.
    
    I nodded.  “She’s been imprinted with set behaviors, but she’s still human, with hopes and fears.  Right now, she’s uncertain, very possibly more than she’s ever been in her whole life.  Her creator more or less had a monopoly on how she behaved.  Grow a child in a vat, imprint them with behaviors that fit the grand plan, stick them in school to surround them with people to mimic and model themselves after, step in now and again to reinforce, shape behavior and train.  I’m the first real challenge to her reality.  I’ve got her questioning things.”
    
    “You make me question my reality,” Gordon said.
    
    “Ha ha,” I said.  Lillian examined my hands, turning them face-up.  She had to squint to see, but she put the powder on the bases of my palms, where I’d scuffed them on the floor during my fall.
    
    “What’s the next step?” Jamie asked.
    
    “Sy’s call,” Gordon said.
    
    “I gave her ideas and things to worry about.  I don’t think she’s going to check in with her compatriots here.  It would increase the chance of running into us a second time.”
    
    “You don’t think she’s confident about their abilities?” Gordon asked.  “She threw that hatchet like a pro.”
    
    “She’s confident in her abilities.  But that’s not where I hit her.  It’s called dissonance.  You believe one thing deeply enough that it’s central to your identity.  Then something, me, steps in to challenge that belief.  It’s a hell of a leap of faith to go from believing something and understanding how much of the world works, to saying ‘I don’t know’.  Some deny, and you can get stupid-as-hell behaviors from those who see something plain as day but deny it because it conflicts with something they believe.  Some get angry, some distract themselves until they can figure out how to deal with it… but very few will turn around and throw themselves headlong into more questions.  More dissonance.”
    
    “If she’s not going to her old friends-” Jamie started.
    
    “Which would force her to face the questions,” I cut in.
    
    “Or coming after us-“
    
    “Risks even more questions,” I added.
    
    Jamie frowned at my interruptions.  “She’s going another place, another route.  Who is she?  How does she operate?  Will she try to escape her worries by fulfilling her mission?”
    
    “I told her that if she tries, she might well lose herself to her imprinted behaviors.  I don’t think so.  She’ll want answers, I think we should track her and get some answers for ourselves.”
    
    “She just covered her trail pretty well there,” Gordon said.  “Is it even possible?”
    
    “It’s possible,” I said.  “We know where she’s going.  She’s going to pay a visit to her creator.”
    
    “Which would be great if we knew who he was,” Jamie said.
    
    “It would,” I said.  “It’s not going to be in the school.  If it was another kind of project, maybe it could be hidden, but if I’m right, and these are clones grown in tubes, then it’s too big a task.  Even ignoring that, she’s trained.  That takes time, and it takes space.  You need room to swing weapons around or practice your aim with a pistol.  A school with thirty members of faculty and over a thousand students isn’t going to give you that.”
    
    “Off-campus, can’t be too far away,” Jamie said.  “How often would this training happen?”
    
    “Training, instructions, shaping behavior,” Gordon said.  “I’d guess once a week?  Can’t say.”
    
    “If they are vat-grown,” Helen said, “Then they’d need training on other fronts.  How to be human, basic niceties.  How to use silverware, how to talk… it might not take too long, but they need to be able to pass.”
    
    “A house,” I said.  “That’s more what we’re looking for than where.”
    
    “With a kitchen, clothes…” Helen said.
    
    “Room to move around,” Gordon said.  “It’s not a small house with walls shared with anyone else.  Neighbors would get suspicious and complain about the noise just as much as anyone else.”
    
    “And,” Jamie said, “There’s the question of how you make a child act well enough like their former self to pass muster with the child’s own parents.”
    
    Gordon frowned.  “I really don’t want to run away with the wrong idea here.  If we go chasing after a wild goose, we might not get another opportunity to get them.  How sure are you, Sy?”
    
    I leaned against the wall.  Lillian finished checking me over, and moved over to Gordon.  She began unbuttoning his shirt.
    
    “How sure?  Um.  It fits.  The little detail thing that Jamie was oh-so-recently trying to get me to focus on.”
    
    “He wasn’t there for that conversation,” Jamie said.
    
    “Wasn’t he?”
    
    “No,” Jamie said, very patiently.
    
    Gordon grunted as Lillian pushed his shoulder back into the socket.  She had him go through a range of motions, extending his arm and moving it around.
    
    “Well, Jamie was talking about the little things that we don’t necessarily pay attention to, that still register in the subconscious.  I made a point of calling Mary an experiment, part of my trying to build a rapport with her.  She never called me out on it or sounded uncomfortable with the idea.  I don’t think she’s ever had illusions about being anything else.  She paid a lot of attention when I talked about roles, identity, labels.  Part of that is going to this school, but part of it is that she’s acting out a role, and has been for a long time.  Whatever’s going on with her, it runs deep.”
    
    “One student died and was autopsied,” Gordon said.  “The rest burned.  Wouldn’t a clone turn up on autopsies?”
    
    “Moment I heard about the remainder being burned, I thought maybe they missed something in the first autopsy, and our puppeteer went out of his way to risk a second close call.  But I don’t know for sure whether it would show up.”
    
    After a pause, we collectively turned to Lillian.
    
    “It depends on a lot,” she said.
    
    “That doesn’t tell us anything,” I said.
    
    “Don’t be a butthole, Sy,” Jamie told me.
    
    I rolled my eyes.
    
    “If he tried to accelerate growth, which he must have, then there’s a good chance something would show up.  There are chemical ways to promote aging.  Hormones, substances, alter the seventh ratio.  But those substances turn up, and they have effects.  Any drug is like a puzzle piece.  We flood the body with puzzle pieces of a particular shape, and intend for those pieces to fit into a specific place and enact a specific function, but you can’t stop it from connecting to other sites, enacting other functions.  It’s how we get side effects.  We control it with how we deliver the medication and other factors, and some of the best graduates of the Academy have it down to an art, making it so one drug only affects one thing in one way, but that’s a delicate balancing act.  That’s without getting into the fact that a badly made clone might be more prone to wear, tear, and side effects.”
    
    “Is our guy that good?” Jamie asked.  “Enough to have the aging drugs down to an art, hiding symptoms from an autopsy?”
    
    “We don’t know,” Gordon said.  “But if what Sy said is true, I’d say he isn’t.  He has one area of focus and he’s giving his all in pursuing it.”
    
    “Okay,” Lillian said.  “The second method is more complimentary, then.  Altering the fundamental pattern of the clones.  Humans mature at an exceptionally slow rate.  We saw people try this a decade ago in the Indian Empire.  Crown scientists tried to make a slave class that grew to maturity, with a specific level of intelligence.  Domesticated humans, strong, playful, good natured, attractive, and obedient.  If I’m not mistaken, they tried a lot of things, including imprinted behaviors.”
    
    Like Mary?  I raised my eyebrows.  “How did it go?”
    
    “How do you think it went, Sy?” Gordon asked.  “Do you see slaves everywhere?”
    
    “That’s not saying it didn’t work,” I said.
    
    “It’s pretty damn indicative,” Gordon said.
    
    “Guys, guys,” Jamie cut in.  “Focus.  Please.  We need to figure out a direction to go, here.”
    
    “It involves other problems,” Lillian said.  “Like the drugs and hormones, it’s an art unto itself.  It requires precision of a different sort, and a broad kind of knowledge.  There’s prior work to draw on, other projects that tried similar things, but there would be signs of the attempt that would crop up in an autopsy, unless the work was perfect.  Change one thing in the pattern, and it has ripple effects throughout the organism’s development and makeup.”
    
    “I didn’t realize it was that difficult,” Helen said.
    
    “Oh my god.  It really, really is,” Lillian said, eyes wide, the incredulity she wasn’t voicing clear in her expression.
    
    “Again, if our puppeteer was that good, why the hell isn’t he already employed by the Academy and earning a small fortune for his talents?” Gordon asked.  A rhetorical question.
    
    Many of us were nodding.
    
    “Got any more suggestions, Lillian?” Jamie asked.  “Because this is good.  Very useful.  But I don’t think it’s screaming ‘this is our guy’.”
    
    “For accelerating aging?  Those would be the best routes,” Lillian said.  “There are others, but I think I’d be wasting our time.”
    
    “Then we’re stuck,” Gordon said.
    
    “No.  Not exactly.  There’s a third possibility,” Lillian said.  “Maybe more, but I’m only thinking of three.  It kind of complicates things.”
    
    “Go on,” Gordon said.
    
    “Don’t,” Lillian said.  “Don’t accelerate the aging.  If you need them to age, you make them age by letting time pass.”
    
    “Mary is twelve,” Gordon said.  “He’s had this plan in the works for twelve years?”
    
    “Yes,” Lillian said.  “Except not exactly.”
    
    I opened my mouth, and Jamie shot me a look.  I closed my mouth before he called me a butthole again for my poking fun at Lillian.
    
    “I said it complicates things,” Lillian said.  “Because our ‘puppeteer’ could strike a balance.  Some natural aging.  Some hormones or changes to the pattern.  The more he relies on real time passing, the less he needs to accelerate the process.  Maybe this project has only been in the works for nine years, or six.”
    
    “Meaning there could be clues,” Gordon said, “Ones that slipped through in the autopsy.”
    
    Lillian nodded.
    
    “More time to develop them,” Helen said.  “Either he inserts them while they’re young, where a half-socialized clone might go unnoticed amid rabid and rambunctious first graders, or he waits and he observes their real counterpart, and he trains the clones to mime the behaviors in his off-hours.”
    
    “Yeah.  We were wondering why he picked Mary,” I said.  “Her parents don’t seem important.  But if this project has been in the works for a while…”
    
    “Maybe we should be looking at who they were,” Gordon finished for me.  “Or who they were supposed to become.  Our puppeteer was taking stabs in the dark, this could be a stab that missed.”
    
    “I can look into that end of things, given time,” Jamie said.
    
    “We might not have a lot of time, but go for it,” I said.  “After you direct me to wherever student records are stored.”
    
    “By the front entrance.  Below the front office.”
    
    “Good,” I said.  “Great.  I’m going.  It’s better if I’m not here.  Assuming Mary hasn’t communicated anything to her fellow clones, they’ll assume I’m dead.  Play it up, act upset and distressed.  Stick together, try to keep them distracted and occupied.  Best case scenario, they’ll still think I’m dead and I can catch them off guard when I’m back.”
    
    “If you do, don’t try to fight them,” Gordon said, his expression blank.
    
    “They’re trained, I know,” I said.
    
    “That, too,” Gordon said.
    
    I frowned, but I was already heading toward the stairs, so I turned on the spot, switching to walking backward, if only to make my expression as clear as possible.
    
    “Lillian,” I spoke up.
    
    She looked at me, a crease between her eyebrows.  Annoyance, worry?
    
    “That Academy know-how you just dropped on us?  That was good.  Smart stuff.”
    
    If anything, the crease between her eyebrows deepened.  Her mouth moved, the start of a frown.
    
    I didn’t see the rest of it.  I headed up the stairs, taking them two at a time, very nearly silent.  I ducked low and peered into the darkness to check the way was clear.  Only when I was on the move again did I spare Lillian’s expression another thought.  I’d given her a compliment, and she’d reacted like I’d slapped her in the face.
    
    Dissonance, I realized.
    
    ☙
    
    The school’s prison-like elements turned out to make being stealthy remarkably difficult.  The rooms were large and every single one, bathrooms excepted, had a window, either facing out into the street or inward, at the yard.  I couldn’t very well turn on the lights without the room illuminating and risking that people half of the Academy’s rooms could see through their windows.
    
    My movements through the front office, thus, were done with the benefit of and detriment of darkness.
    
    The doors, I had to assume, were locked.  At the same time, people were far worse about attending to windows.
    
    Water ran down over me and through my hair while I scaled the wooden branches and twigs that grew into and around the masonry.  It was far finer than the usual, not quite branches but not so thin as to be ivy, it was thorny, to discourage children in the yard from climbing on it, but it was still a place where I could find handholds, if I was careful to do it.
    
    All the same, I was left bleeding in no less than five places; I couldn’t always see the thorns in the dark.
    
    I reached the window and teased it open.  I slipped inside, then closed it behind me.
    
    Glancing outside, I didn’t see any lights going on, suggesting that a faculty member might have seen the dark shape scaling the paler wall.
    
    Jamie had told me that the records were kept beneath the front office, and my experience with the headmistress had suggested the office’s location.  Rather than go straight for the records, I found myself in the room between the front entrance and the principal’s office.  Typewriters sat on desks where the secretaries were stationed, benches lined one half of the room, and desks and cabinets of papers and supplies filled the other half.
    
    The principal’s office, once I found it with its name plate on the door, proved to be unlocked.  I was glad I didn’t have to go out and back in again.
    
    The interior of her office had a desk and chair, cabinets, some pictures meant to impress parents more than please herself or her students.  There were prominent faces I couldn’t name depicted on the wall.  Gradutes of Academies.  A ‘this could be your student in ten years’ thing.
    
    But I knew that however good she was, few people remembered every detail about every single one of the people who worked under them.  If some of her staff slept in the building, some slept out, she still needed a means of contacting them.
    
    I found a box of notecards, filled with teacher’s names and mailing addresses.  I took it with me.
    
    Humans were complex creatures.  Add the rewriting of patterns, augmentations, grafts, revival, drugs, and everything else, and ‘human’ became an awfully unclear term.  Every new discovery meant the introduction of things that had never been done or discovered before, more things that muddied the waters.
    
    Or bloodied them.
    
    My ‘gang’ was muddy and bloody both, but they were fairly simple, with defined roles.  Here, in this, I was the odd one out.  If all five of the other projects were successes, I might never have been given the go-ahead.  It was sobering, to know that the foundation and excuse for my being rested on the backs of two corpses.
    
    Two who were like me.
    
    I’d been asked, once, how I could predict people as I did.  Jamie, I think, had raised the subject.  My answer had been simple.
    
    Humans as a species were like a collection of bugs in a box.  Left alone, it was hard to predict how they’d move, or the patterns that would form.
    
    Shake the box, and it generated chaos.  Maddened, they would seek to escape, butting their heads against barriers.  They would turn on their closest neighbors and strike out.  Even seek to kill.  In their frenzied movements, they were very predictable.
    
    Jamie had been very quiet after that response of mine.
    
    But it was true.  It worked on many levels.  Force people into darkness, then offer them a light, and they were a moth to a candle flame.
    
    The darkness that surrounded Mothmont wasn’t my darkness.  It was meant to work against me.
    
    But it was darkness I could use.  The headmistress was worried, and I very much doubted she was sleeping after so many of her students fell ill.  Many of them had rich and powerful parents.  She’d been driven into a corner.
    
    Taking a blank piece of paper from the drawer of her desk, I placed it on the top, and I penned out a simple statement with a fountain pen.
    
    The Academy would like for you to please order a quarantine.  Your students are to be fully examined in the wake of their illnesses, regardless of whether they fell ill.  Take care that it includes one and all, and that it is by members of the Academy. 
    
    None of the blame in this lies with you.  Provided you speak of this letter to no-one, you have nothing to worry about.  All will be well.
    
    Giving the moth her candle flame.
    
    The only way this situation could go sour was if something happened to my group, or if more of the puppeteer’s Bad Seeds decided to make a break for their families.
    
    The quarantine would keep that from happening and it would force our adversaries into a corner.  If there was something they were trying to hide from an autopsy, they might well be uncomfortable with a full physical examination.
    
    The only danger was that she might not listen.
    
    Let it never be said that I couldn’t have fun.
    
    I opened the fountain pen and took a second to work it out.  There was a syringe by the ink bottle.
    
    I hated needles.
    
    But I didn’t hate them so much that it would stop me.
    
    I took a minute to empty the pen with the syringe, and then took another minute to refill the syringe with blood from a thorn-puncture in my palm.
    
    I penned out an illegible signature in blood.
    
    Let her think about that.
    
    I locked the door,then locked all but one of the windows.  Removing a shoe to wipe at the drips of water on the floor, retreating while I covered my tracks, I found my way to the remaining window and drew out a bit of thread from my sleeve and cut it with a letter opener, which I pocketed.  I carefully looped it around the latch-end, leaving more than enough slack – there was a good foot between my hand and the loop that sat around the latch’s arm.  Only tension keeping things from falling to mess and disaster.  Pointing up, the latch was unlocked.  A simple turn meant it fit into a waiting cradle, and resisted attempts to open the window.
    
    I climbed out of the window, then eased the window shut.  Pulling on the thread with the knot, I worked the latch down, until it sat in the cradle.
    
    I pulled on one end of the thread, and worked it out of the gap in the window.
    
    There.
    
    Let her wonder who at the Academy would be leaving her a message signed in blood, in a room with all means of entrance and egress properly locked and sealed.
    
    Hopefully while she was wondering she wouldn’t be telling herself she couldn’t risk the quarantine.
    
    I headed down one floor, sticking myself with a few more thorns on the way.  I was thoroughly soaked by the time I reached the set of windows on the ground floor.
    
    The letter opener slid between windows to lift a latch.  I let myself into the records room.
    
    The benefits of an organization being as hoity-toity as Mothmont were that they kept good records.  I had what I needed in two minutes.  Mary Cobourn.  I tucked it into my waistband behind my back, and pulled my shirt down to cover it.
    
    I exited through a window opposite the one I’d entered, stepping out onto the street beyond Mothmont.
    
    The rain poured down on me and the notecards.  I didn’t care.
    
    She had them categorized.  Staff was a category.
    
    Of that staff, two thirds were women.
    
    I found myself fumbling through the cards that remained, wishing Jamie were around.
    
    Jamie would know the names of streets better than I did, even in an unfamiliar end of town.
    
    Still, we knew they were close.  If these students were paying regular visits, they had to be slipping away in the evenings, or when others were making their special visits to the Academy.
    
    House, I thought.
    
    I placed two cards back in the box when the addresses suggested apartments.
    
    Another card, McCairn’s, proved to be too far away.  Poor bastard probably had to travel a ways every morning and night.
    
    Unless he was staying at the Academy like he had tonight.  Either way, I felt confident in ruling him out.
    
    Richards, Harper, Mason, Kelly, Caldwell, Percy, and Blankenship.
    
    I moved at a quick pace through the rain, favoring the parts of the street where the lamp-light didn’t shine.  The only soul who saw me was a large man that was walking a near-empty cart of bodies through the streets, ringing a bell with a low tone.  Coin for bodies.  The area here was too nice for it to be lucrative, compared to areas closer to the orphanage where people couldn’t pay their way out of being sick.  I guessed he probably only did a walk-around once a month or once every few weeks.  Often only at night, because of the reactions the wagons drew in public.
    
    If our puppeteer wasn’t entirely alone, there could well be a few adventurous sorts who might do the reverse transaction, lightening the wagon.
    
    I considered for a second, then caught up with him.
    
    It was so very human of him to be startled by my sudden, quiet appearance.  I thought for a second he might have messed himself, but the smell came from one of the bodies.
    
    He seemed immune to the smell.  He wore a heavy rain-cloak that trailed down all the way to his calves, and was thin, with lanky hair suggesting he perhaps didn’t eat most nights.
    
    Maybe he was doing his rounds here because others had edged him out of another territory.
    
    “Has any one person delivered a number of children your way?” I asked.
    
    “Children?”  He frowned.
    
    “Boys and girls, about my age, or a little younger.”
    
    “Dunno,” he said.
    
    I badly wished I had some coins to spare.
    
    “These street names,” I said.  I held up cards, pointing.  “Where are these?”
    
    He gave me some quick directions.
    
    “Any with big houses?”
    
    He shrugged.  “Most.  Why?”
    
    “Work with me, I’ll make it worth your while.”
    
    He scoffed.
    
    I remained still and silent, hoping that he might come around if I was serious enough.
    
    He didn’t.  At the end of the day, I was only a child, half-drowned in the heavy rain.
    
    “Out of my way if you don’t want to get run over,” he said.
    
    I stepped closer, and I stuck the letter opener into his crotch.  Not hard enough to pierce anything, but enough to let him know there was a point to it.
    
    I didn’t say or do anything.  I remained where I was, a blade held close to a part no man wanted to lose.
    
    I waited, once more, not moving or making a noise, hoping he would come around this time.
    
    My hand went up, holding the soaked cards with their running ink.  He caught my wrist, and for a second I thought he had me.
    
    I pushed the point a little deeper, and his entire pelvis moved back.  I was careful to keep the blade in place.  I suspected the point might have hooked on a tag of skin, incentivizing him to stay right where he was.
    
    There was a growl to his voice as he said, “Trellis is closest further down that way.  Then Yarrow, a little to the right, then in same direction, then Olds which is a hard right.  You’ll see the other two streets if you stick to Olds.  Biggest houses on Yarrow.”
    
    I nodded, “Let go of me, now.”
    
    He did.
    
    I twisted away, withdrawing my letter opener, and splashed off into the rain.
    
    Trellis was dark.  The buildings looked more like apartments than anything else.
    
    Yarrow was where I found my prize.  Mr. Percy’s residence.
    
    The lights weren’t on, but there was a candle flame on the second floor, and as ever, the branches were inviting in how they offered me places for my hands and feet.
    
    I got as close as I could to the window where I’d spied the candle flame, where it rose from a steeply sloping roof, and I listened.
    
    “…the boys!?” Mary’s voice rose at the end, a question.
    
    There we go, I thought.
    
    And she was using the words I’d given her, using my labels.
    
    I sat back and listened."""
    
    taking_root.append(taking_root_8)
    
    taking_root_9 = """Taking Root one point nine. “Mary, I won’t talk to you while you’re being like this.”
    
    “I’m scared!  I’ve never been scared!  And you’re not answering my questions, which-”
    
    “Mary.”
    
    “-isn’t making me feel any better!”
    
    I shifted positions and settled back, now that I knew I was close enough to hear, the box of notecards in my lap, the contents thoroughly soaked.  The words were muffled by the intervening wall and window, but I could make them out and differentiate the speakers.  The man, who I was assuming was Percy, was speaking in a very careful, measured tone.
    
    Mary was displaying more emotion in a given word than I’d seen from her during my entire discussion with her.
    
    The rain streamed over me, and I pushed my hair straight back, away from my face, glad that it was so very wet that it didn’t just spring back into the most inconvenient position.  I was soaked through, and imagined that the spot at my back where the file was tucked into my waistband was so wet that the print from the pages was staining my skin.
    
    It wouldn’t, but I still imagined it.
    
    Where my skin was new on my arms and various points on my body, I could feel the cold of the rain like rough circles of ice.  The passage of a single droplet left an ache singing through my nerves for seconds after it was gone.
    
    I shifted over, so the section of the room that jutted out to frame the window was tight against one of my arms and the slight overhang of shingles provided a bit of shelter.  It helped.
    
    The puppeteer spoke, “Mary.  I told you to be ready for anything, that the Academy was almost guaranteed to respond.  You did very well to discover them as early and accurately as you did.  I’m proud of you for accomplishing that.”
    
    “It wasn’t anything special.  A group of kids shows up all at once?  Just had to keep an eye on them.  The boys-”
    
    “The boys,” he said, and he gave the word a different tone in the process.  He was apparently noting the phrasing.
    
    “They did most of the work there, finding the group from the Academy.”
    
    “I’m still proud of you, Mary,” he said.  There was a pause, uncomfortable and long.  I had to fight the urge to peek in the window.  The puppeteer resumed, his voice low and soothing, as if talking to an infant “Deep breath now.  In… and out.  There we go.  Tears wiped away, hair fixed up, and you’re not so flustered.  Do you feel a little better?”
    
    “A little.”
    
    “We knew they would send someone or something.  I warned you to be prepared for anything.”
    
    “I thought it would be… one of those tools you hear the Academy talking about.  The Dog and Catcher, or the man with the hands.  Something like that.  I was expecting to have to deal with monsters, I didn’t…”
    
    “You didn’t…?” the puppeteer asked, trailing off much as Mary had.
    
    “I wasn’t prepared for them to be like that.”
    
    My eyebrows were already up.
    
    The Dog and Catcher were well known enough as they could be seen around town, but I was surprised that ‘the man with the hands’ had come up.  That would be the Hangman file from the Academy, and that file was pretty damn confidential.  Enough so that even I hadn’t known about it until I’d started to wonder what special project the Tackhouse had put together and went out of my way to get the file.
    
    Had the little clones here been similarly busy during Mothmont’s excursions to the Academy?
    
    “You’re very much alive, Mary, which you might well not be if it was another individual or group from the Academy.  I’m quite grateful for that fact.”
    
    “I don’t know how to move forward, and I don’t like standing still when I’m not sure where I stand.  The boys-”
    
    “Your brothers are your brothers, nothing else.  You were born from the same womb.  Have I spent half as much time in their company as I have in yours?”
    
    “No,” Mary said.
    
    “You look like you still have doubts,” he said.
    
    “I’m okay,” Mary said.  “About the children from the Academy-”
    
    “Don’t change the subject.  Do you have doubts, Mary?”
    
    “Yes.”
    
    “Try to voice them.  I’d like a chance to answer them.”
    
    “I feel as though, if I had to guess, you might have told them that they were special, and you only spend time with me because I need the extra practice and training.”
    
    “No, Mary.  No, no no,” he said.  I could hear the huff of a heavy sigh.  “I’m so caught off guard by the idea that I don’t even know what to say.”
    
    “I knew it was unfair,” Mary said, and her voice was so quiet I could barely hear it.  “There isn’t a right answer, nothing you could say that would make me feel better.  So I wasn’t going to say anything.  It’s poison they put into my head, and I don’t want the poison to bleed out into this.  Us, our family, our home.”
    
    “Tell me.  Share your worries when they come up.  I know that what we’re doing here is a lonely exercise.  I rely on you and your brothers to be my hands, while I continue to refine my work.  I hope you can rely on me in the same way.”
    
    Her reply was so soft I couldn’t hear it.
    
    “Good,” he said.  “That’s what I like to hear.”
    
    “What do we do?”
    
    “Your brothers are in the dark?”
    
    “Yes.”
    
    “We fix that, first.  I’m glad you came to me, but as special as you are to me, I do care about your brothers.”
    
    “Yes.”
    
    “We can’t do anything about this unknown member of the group.  From your description, I imagine she’s better suited against specific threats that are vulnerable to a chemical or counteragent.”
    
    “I thought about that.  She can’t do anything without communication, either.  The members of the Academy children have to give her information to work with, if she’s going to do anything to find us.  If we wait and watch, they’ll eventually lead us to her.”
    
    I wanted to laugh.  The irony.
    
    “The boy, Gordon, he was a physical threat?”
    
    “I don’t know if you could call him that.  He’s stronger than he looks.  He shoved his way through a locked door.  Sylvester, the one I talked to, he said Gordon was the one to watch out for.  Described him as being a jack of trades, or something like that.  Physical prowess.”
    
    “The one to watch out for.  Do you believe him?”
    
    “No.  Not completely.  But he said Gordon would come for you, if they identified you.”
    
    “They will, and he will, I think,” the puppeteer said.
    
    “I don’t want that.”
    
    “Nor do I.  But I don’t see any way around it.  This is how the Academy operates, and just as we can’t cry over the rain, which we cannot change, we cannot cry about the Academy being what it is.”
    
    “I like the rain,” Mary said, and her voice was a hair louder than it had been.
    
    I was sitting beside the window, to the point where I was looking across it rather than into it, but the square of orange where the glass had caught the light from within changed as Mary’s head and upper body blocked some of it.
    
    She was only two feet from me, and she didn’t even know it.
    
    I shifted one hand to cover the spot on my arm where it was sensitive, the cold almost unbearable.  Unfortunately, the backs of my hands had suffered as much as anything, and the cold rain touched them just as sharply.
    
    The light shifted again.  The puppeteer had drawn closer to the window as well.
    
    “A moment ago you said you were afraid.  For the first time?”
    
    “Yes.”
    
    “Fear is rooted in the unknown.  I think that is why great minds tend to find such an unreasonable confidence in the process of plumbing it.  They face the unknown, they conquer it, and they diminish it until it no longer holds sway over them, and they continue to charge onward.”
    
    “When you say great minds, do you include yourself?”
    
    “I don’t.”
    
    “I would,” Mary retorted, without hesitation.
    
    “You’re biased.  Someone could say I’m clever, and I might agree with them, but I wouldn’t say I’m great.  We’re getting sidetracked.”
    
    “I’m sorry.”
    
    “I wasn’t planning on sharing this with you.  It’s not because I was hiding anything, but because I didn’t see the need.  But if it helps you forge through the unknown, there’s a need.  I may not know who they are, but I know what they are.  Or is it the other way around?”
    
    “The Academy children?”
    
    “Yes.  More than a decade ago, I was involved with the Academy.”
    
    “Involved?”
    
    “The system and structure were different.  For a time, the amount of space outpaced the glut of students.  They opened the doors and let some in.”
    
    “You?  Really?”
    
    “I was one such individual.  Not a true student.  I didn’t pay a tuition, and I didn’t ever harbor delusions of being a graduate, a teacher or a professor.  They left us scraps, told us that when classes weren’t full we could fight between ourselves to take the additional spots.  We could use the libraries, and we had to put in a certain number of hours in service to the Academy.  Each and every one of us knew that if a paying student walked in the door, one of us would be leaving in that same heartbeat.  Those of us who endured it did so because we were hungry for it.”
    
    “Why?”
    
    “Why were we hungry, or why did we do it?” the puppeteer asked.
    
    “Why did you do it?  How could you stand being second class citizens?”
    
    Does that rub you the wrong way?  Do you think that if people knew what you were, that they would put you a rung lower than any ‘true’ human?  Think you derivative?  A curio?
    
    “We were told that we were training to be assistants.  To know our way around the labs and the books and to know what needed stirring and how often, or to be effective sounding boards for the real great minds, when they were talking their way through a problem.  Every seat we were able to claim for ourselves was another dollar we were worth.”
    
    “It’s weird, hearing you talk about the Academy like this.  You hate them.”
    
    “I do.  That doesn’t mean I don’t value the knowledge or the education.  I got my position at Mothmont.  Everything they promised came true.”
    
    “But?”
    
    “But we’re getting off topic,” he said.
    
    “That’s not what I was asking.”
    
    “I’m giving you a different answer to a different question.  Listen, I managed to barter my way into a seat for a class, I think it was called ‘The Applied Mind’.  We were given projects.  Brainstorming, application.  Students had to work in groups, and I was paired with another non-student student.  He lost his position in the school, leaving me entirely on my own.  My project was amateurish, more concept than anything close to a proper execution.  But I got to sit through the entire class and I got glimpses of the work others did.  They kept it quiet, but they couldn’t completely silence twenty-five students out of a class of sixty.  The timing made too much sense, with the first appearance of certain special projects.”
    
    “You’re talking about the Academy children?  They’re the work the other groups did?”
    
    “Yes, I think so.  You’ve already told me some of it.  I moved on to another year of classes, and I heard through word of mouth that the project had fallen through, not enough viable results.  Died in the womb.  I saw how despondent some of the students were, and I believed it.  I heard the department was getting cut back a great deal, and I believed that too.  I still do.  I paid attention for two more months, and then my seat was taken.”
    
    “They’re not just a special project, but a secret one?”
    
    “One of several.  But, based on everything you’ve shared with me, those details I could process in the rare moments you stopped for breath, I remain suspicious these Academy children are a failed project.”
    
    “Failed?”
    
    “Only a suspicion.  The funding is spent, the department was cut back, but several of the projects lived, and it costs relatively little to keep an ongoing project operating.  Perhaps other failures were given a second chance because it was inexpensive.  It would explain the group being larger than it should.  Thus, we would have a failed project maintained as long as there is spare change to keep it going, made use of whenever an appropriate situation comes up.”
    
    “He said something about being injured, and it was recent.  I don’t think we’re the first job they’ve done lately.”
    
    “That doesn’t mean it isn’t a niche project,” he said.
    
    “That’s true.”
    
    “I was there for the conception, the brainstorming, and the discussions.  All I took away was that it wasn’t a roaring success, and a great many people were disappointed.  I don’t think I retained anything else that’s noteworthy… well, one thing, of course.”
    
    “One thing?”
    
    “You, Mary.  Your brothers.  You were my project.  The seed of the idea was born then.  It sat with me for a few years, until I had the means to make it happen.”
    
    Mary was silent.
    
    “You were a gamble.  You still are, but back then, I remember losing sleep.  I tried to put two projects forward, but I only had so much time to dedicate to the task.  I had to make a decision.  Would I follow the instructions to the letter with an inferior idea, or would I present you, knowing that you were novel as an approach, but doomed to be dismissed for not fitting to the rules?”
    
    “He said- Sylvester said that the Academy prizes innovation.”
    
    “Yes.  He’s right, and that idea is probably why I decided to do what I did.  I thought a great deal about what happened back then.  What I’d do differently, given a second chance.  Then I decided to see it through, and I did it on my own, which is something they can never forgive me for.”
    
    “Because they want control,” she said.
    
    “Yes.  As much as they prize innovation, they prize control more.  A mind that runs away with ideas is cherished there, so long as it remains there.  Within or with the Academy.  Here?  Past arm’s length?  Not something cherished, but despised.  That’s our enemy.”
    
    “A little less of an unknown,” Mary said.
    
    “Yes.  Now you know why they’re doing what they’re doing.  You have a sense of who they are.  A failed venture.  Does that take some of the fear away?”
    
    “Yes.”
    
    “Your hand,” he said.  There was a pause.  “Look at that, it’s as steady as a rock.  Arm yourself, conceal the weapons, but bring enough to arm your brothers.  I’m going to the school, and you’re coming with me.”
    
    “You’re going to the school?” she asked, and she sounded anything but calm.  I heard sounds as she followed the instructions, all the same.
    
    “Where do you think I should go?”
    
    “Anywhere but the school.”
    
    “You don’t think they’ll find me?  Or that they might have sent other resources after us?  I’m safest in your company, in the cover of the crowd, or where I can use my power as a member of the school faculty.  I’ll have all three of those things at the school for as long as I’m there, which won’t be for long.  You can’t communicate with your brothers for as long as the Academy children know your face.  Leave that much to me.”
    
    “I don’t like it.”
    
    “I suppose you wouldn’t.  You were always my most careful one.”
    
    “You’re going ahead with this?”
    
    “I don’t see any other way to do it.  Trust me, Mary.  I gave you a wealth of talents, but I’m not without my own.  This is something I can manage.”
    
    “I don’t want you to get hurt.  I’m not as afraid for me, but my fear for you is enough that I can barely think straight!”
    
    “Mary-”
    
    “Please.  You made me, you raised me, I’ve never refused to obey.  I’ve done everything you asked.  Let me have a say just once.”
    
    “You would have me abandon your brothers?”
    
    “You said they weren’t that viable.  They know what they have to do.  If they make it, they’ll fulfill their mission.  Let’s go.  Leave, take the notes, drain the tanks, burn the house to erase the evidence.  The Academy won’t catch up to us if we’re quick about it.”
    
    “I won’t do that.”
    
    “You said it was about me and you.  That I’d be by your side as the elder sister to all the viables.  Do this for me, prove it.  Prove that.”
    
    “If I sacrificed your brothers to save my own skin, you would always suspect that I would do the same to you.”
    
    “No.  I wouldn’t, I promise.  Please, don’t make what he said true.  Prove that you’re right.  Prove it!”
    
    “Mary-”
    
    “Prove it!”
    
    There was a frantic edge to the words, now.
    
    In stark contrast, the puppeteer’s voice was low and drawn out, voicing multiple syllables I couldn’t put together into a word.  A nonsense utterance with a cadence to it.
    
    Mary had fallen silent.
    
    An imprinted phrase?  Planned, crafted as something that wouldn’t be repeated in everyday conversation.
    
    I heard noise, but from the heavy footsteps and creaks, I took it to be him and him alone.  Papers rustling, a thud, steps disappearing into another room, very possibly downstairs.
    
    Almost a minute passed before his return.
    
    “Take it,” he said.  “Drink.  Keep drinking… there.  You’re dehydrated and tired.  It’s been a long night.  Finish collecting the weapons and tools, we’re leaving as soon as I have my coat.”
    
    “I-” Mary started.  “I don’t-”
    
    Far more hesitant than she’d been a minute and a half ago.
    
    What exactly had happened?
    
    And was it something I could use?
    
    I shifted my position, grabbing the rain-slick windowsill and leaning out and over, to glimpse the front face of the large house, locating the front door.
    
    I slid as much as I crawled, dragging myself across the rooftop, beneath the window’s field of view, to get to the other side, and it was even more awkward a process with the box of notecards still occupying one of my hands.
    
    My uniform was filthy, and it wasn’t just muck and dirt, but with the crawl over the shingles it was a muck and dirt that had been driven into the fabric.  I took care finding Percy’s notecard in the dark, then tucked it into a pants pocket.  The rest of the notecards I clamped between my teeth.
    
    I waited, listening as the puppeteer resumed speaking.  “I need you to focus.  It’s been a long night, but my well being and your well being depend on your ability to watch our backs.  Remind me why you’re my best work.”
    
    “Yes,” she said, and the word was warm with pride at the same time it was just a little faint.  Whatever he’d done to her, she was still reeling from it.
    
    I made sure my position was secure, then snapped off the end of a shingle, where rain and weather had worn it down to the point where it was soft, hanging over the gutter.
    
    I did the same for the next length of shingle, though it required a little more work.
    
    Each piece was as thick as eight or so pieces of paper put together, two fingers’ width wide, and of varying lengths, all gritty like sandpaper.
    
    Each piece of shingle went into the box.
    
    I scooted along further, pausing now and again to listen, hearing nothing.  More shingles went into the box, but it wasn’t much larger than a brick, and I soon reached the point where the shingles were being wedged in rather than dropped in.
    
    It was true I wasn’t good in a fight, but that didn’t mean I didn’t occasionally have my moments.
    
    The trick was to avoid making it a proper fight, per se.
    
    I rolled my shoulders, and found they were still stiff.  My arms were cold.
    
    The door opened below me, and in my eagerness to react, I very nearly launched myself forward, over the gutter, and two stories down to the ground.
    
    I hefted the weight of the box that had held the notecards.  It wasn’t so heavy.  Five, six pounds.  A little larger than a brick, and about as heavy.
    
    While Mary was reeling from whatever the puppeteer had done to her, she might be slower to react.  I had to gauge my options, trust my ability, see them step away from the door after the puppeteer had locked it.
    
    I got my first glimpse of the man.  Tall, hair slicked back from a widow’s peak, casually forming what looked like two horns, pointing at some area behind the back of his head.  Streaks of grey reached back from his temples.  His mustache-less facial hair swept forward much as his hair swept back, the point of the beard extending the chin of an already long face.  His jacket was long and clung to his body, adding to his apparent height and very lean build.  It was in the style of a lab coat without actually being a lab coat, very fashionable, and black.  It said as much about the man as anything else.
    
    All put together, he was meticulous.  It was the first and last word that sprung to mind.
    
    I’d heard his confidence as he talked about how he’d fend for himself at the school.  I knew how hard it might be to get to him, or to catch up to him once he tapped the available resources and made his escape to some other town.
    
    Mary hadn’t quite believed him when he’d said he would be okay.
    
    I did.
    
    Which was why I brought the box back, and smashed the window with it.
    
    I saw him stop, turning.  Mary turned too, but it was a slow reaction.
    
    I’d seen Gordon in a good fight.  There were moments where I’d seen him throw a punch as his opponent turned their head, so it made the hit worse.  The opposite of rolling with the punches.  I’d fallen in love with the image and tried to emulate it in a fistfight and been kicked in the ribs several times over for my trouble.
    
    In this case, it was pure accident, but he made it happen.  His head turned to look up at me, and the brick-ish box of shingles had already left my hand.  He brought his face straight into it.
    
    I saw spatters of darkness that might have been blood, and I saw his ass hit the wet footpath leading between the door and the road.
    
    I wanted to crow my victory to the night sky, to laugh at the success my ribs had suffered for just months ago, but that might have ruined the effect.
    
    Better to stay a small, dark, dirty, drenched shape on the roof, and see if I could re-awaken little Mary’s fear all over again.  Fear of me, and fear for her puppeteer’s safety.
    
    I saw her crouch, caught between keeping an eye on me and helping the puppeteer.
    
    She had weapons, I knew.  She could throw a hatchet, and knives weren’t out of the question.
    
    In a throwing contest, she was liable to win.
    
    I had to turn up the pressure.  The moment this became a contest of skill or strength, she would win.
    
    I reached into the broken window, disappointed that the lights were off, and felt inside until I found a wine bottle with only a few gulps left in it.  I hucked it at them.
    
    Mary put herself between Percy and the bottle, hunching over so it smashed against her shoulder.  The top end disappeared into the grass at the boundary of the property.
    
    The irony being that if she hadn’t put herself in the way, the course would have led to me missing entirely.
    
    I found a book and threw that, but it opened in mid-air, drifting off course.  It landed a few feet to their left, my right.
    
    “I’ll kill you,” she said, her voice carrying over the patter of the rain.
    
    “Try it,” I said, blindly fumbling for the next thing I might be able to throw.  “Come after me.  We can play hide and seek, and the moment you lose track of me, it’ll be because I’m busy slitting his throat.”
    
    I held up the letter opener.
    
    She didn’t need to know that it wasn’t particularly sharp.  She just needed to know that I was armed.
    
    But the gesture was a mistake, because it gave her a window to act, where she didn’t need to shield the puppeteer.  I didn’t even see her palm the knife, and her entire body moved with the throwing motion.
    
    Not entirely surprised, I swung lazily to one side, holding on to the top of the window frame, moving over to the other side.
    
    She was already readying to throw again.  Two knives at once?
    
    I swung again, hoping to irritate her into making a mistake.  I badly underestimated how good she was.  The first knife hit the window frame a quarter-foot in front of my face.  A slightly faster swing, and it would have hit me.
    
    The second knife… I didn’t feel or hear it land, and the lack of sensory awareness fed straight into that ‘prey instinct’ that Jamie and I had discussed.
    
    A sense that something was wrong.
    
    She’d pretended to throw two at once, but had held back the other.  Before I’d fully processed the fact that I’d almost swung right into the knife’s path, she was throwing it in a simple clean, crisp motion.  No choreographing, no putting her entire body into the throw.  The sort of thing I could very nearly miss if I wasn’t paying enough attention.
    
    She’s aiming for-
    
    The half formed thought was enough to make me let go of the window frame, falling and sliding until both of my feet landed in the gutter, the back of my head banging against the windowsill.
    
    The knife buried itself into the spot where my hand had been.  While I’d been moving from side to side, my hand had been staying in place, keeping me from falling.
    
    This time I was paying attention to what her hands were doing.  They traced the bottom of her uniform top and the fingers curled inward, holding what was presumably another throwing knife.
    
    I grinned at her.  “I saw that.  Not quite subtle enough.”
    
    “Don’t waste them,” the puppeteer said, raising one hand to the side of his face, then removing it, revealing a mess of blood on the fingers.  “He’s baiting you.”
    
    “He’s a bastard,” she said.
    
    “I never pretended to be anything but,” I said.  I reached up for a grip on the windowsill, and found a large piece of glass.  I whipped it at her.
    
    She blocked it much as she had the bottle, flinching as it broke.  One of the eyes she’d closed remained closed after she lowered her arm.
    
    “Go, we gain nothing by staying.  I can walk,” I heard the puppeteer say.  He rose, and Mary was quick to put her entire body under one of his arms, helping him to stand and put a few more steps worth of distance between us.
    
    “What about the lab?” Mary said, looking up at me.
    
    “It’s as good as gone,” the puppeteer said, mumbling some of the sounds.  The hit to his face seemed to have caught his cheekbone and nose, but that was somehow impacting his speech, too.  The skin was badly split, and it looked ragged enough that a shingle’s edge might have caught it.  An impact and a sawtooth edge.
    
    I’d got him good, it seemed.
    
    That wasn’t the sort of thing that made me want to shout my glee to the heavens.  The satisfaction was colder, quieter.
    
    “You don’t have all your work,” Mary said.
    
    “I have enough to start over.  If he wants to destroy it, he can destroy it.  Survival is paramount, and that includes yours, Mary.”
    
    Hearing him, I almost believed it, and I would have if I hadn’t heard his special word and noted the aftermath.
    
    I pulled another piece of glass free of the window itself, where it was only hanging on because of the paint.  I wasn’t strong enough to give it proper distance without putting so much into the throw that I’d lose all accuracy.  They were too far back, standing on the street now.  Mary and her hobbling puppeteer.
    
    She was glaring at me through one eye, the other staying shut.
    
    They turned, Mary watching me out of the corner of her eye, supporting the puppeteer as they retreated in the general direction of the school.
    
    I counted the seconds between each over-the-shoulder glance she gave me.
    
    One, two, three… glance.
    
    One, two, three… glance.
    
    One, two, three, fo- glance.
    
    One two three, glance.
    
    One, two, three, four, pausing for breath, a long stare back in my direction.
    
    One, two, three, four, glance.
    
    The moment she turned away, I moved.  To one side, to break line of sight, putting the corner of a building between us, then down the face of the building.  It was a reckless, haphazard descent, one where I fell more than I descended, stopping myself now and again with a grab at a window shutter or a bit of branch.
    
    Providing the moths a flame to follow was one thing.  Creating a desire and filling it, destroying the prey at the conclusion.
    
    It was another to leave your enemy only one path, and follow them along it.
    
    I wasn’t strong.  I might never be.  Gordon could have brained the man with the shingle box.  Hell, even Helen could’ve.  Jamie could have done more damage, but probably would never have hit.  I’d hurt the puppeteer, at the very least.  Mankind had a long and involved history of being hunters, following a wounded beast for miles.
    
    He’d already been intent on getting to Mothmont and gathering the boys, his three other killers.  Now it was the only place nearby that he had access to where he could tend to his injured face.
    
    Nine in ten chance he would do that.  One in ten chance that the blow to his head would leave him relying on Mary.
    
    It meant I didn’t need to follow, exactly.  That carried its own risks, when little Mary was so very good at throwing things at people.  Better to lag behind, to watch my flanks and move with appropriate care and caution.
    
    If I happened to catch up with them, there was nothing I could do to capitalize on the situation.  If I stayed back, out of sight, then she had to wonder, and that wondering was a very useful tool.  It made every decision she made more difficult, with more variables to consider.  Every step of the way, she had to watch her back.
    
    Approaching the school, I found my way to the same alcove where the coach had stopped to drop me off, and peered around the corner.
    
    The puppeteer was alone, his keys rattling as he stood at the locked gate.
    
    I immediately whirled around, looking, searching.
    
    No Mary in sight.
    
    You want to play that game, Mary?  I thought.
    
    I’d really hoped that her bond to her creator would mean she stayed close to him, even as he got to the school.  But she was sticking to the plan.  I couldn’t go for the man without risking that Mary would step out and kill me, much as she’d promised back at Percy’s home.
    
    I’d angered her enough that she was going to kill me very, very thoroughly, if she got the chance.
    
    I could go straight for the puppeteer, but that was a gamble.  Was Mary close?  Hiding?  Would she intercept me?  She had a couple of inches on me in height, she had been trained, honed, and I wasn’t positive I could outrun her if it came down to it.
    
    I didn’t like that gamble.
    
    The man was still working to find the right key when the gate opened.
    
    It was the headmistress.
    
    “Mister Percy!” she exclaimed.  I looked through the window and thought it was a vagrant.  What happened!?”
    
    “I was feeling better,” he said, mumbling.  He coughed and spat, “Thought I’d check how things were.  A thug on the street waylaid me.”
    
    “Good mercy.  Get yourself inside.  We’ll get you patched up.”
    
    I heard the gate shut and click.  That was my mark to go, double checking for a murderous Mary, then heading to the same window I’d used to exit the building, slipping inside.
    
    My shoes had hard soles.  I slipped them off.  Comfort was secondary to moving quietly.
    
    If I could get past Mary to reach Percy, I won.  If Mary could get to any of us, possibly excepting Gordon or very possibly Helen, it was over.  We’d never get the advantage over them with one of ours down and out.  If she could reach her group, they’d have an overwhelming advantage.  If I could reach mine… well, we’d be a group, and I could share what I knew.  In a situation as tenuous as this, their combined strength beat out ours.
    
    Lopsided, as games went.  Her with her arsenal of knives and whatever else, me with my letter opener and the knowledge that she was scared, though she was only willing to show it to her maker.
    
    Who, as he’d endeavored to communicate to her, wasn’t to be discounted as a player of our dark little game.
    
    I smiled to myself as I darted off into the recesses of the building."""
    
    taking_root.append(taking_root_9)
    
    taking_root_10 = """Taking Root one point ten. This was what I lived for.  Literally speaking.
    
    I knew my enemy now.  I knew where she was weak, where she was strong.  I knew how dangerous she was, and through all of that I could make assumptions about the others in the school.  I might have preferred to know where she was and interact with her from a safe vantage point, but this was the next best thing.
    
    I knew that the best way to handle this would be to get to the puppeteer, Mr. Percy, and deal with him before anything else.  He was hurt, my odds weren’t that bad.  Once he fell, the others would fall.  I knew that Mary knew the same thing, and would react accordingly.  She knew I knew, and I knew that.
    
    Ad infinitum.
    
    I liked these games, when the system broke down.  It was no longer about how good we were at predicting and planning.  We were both just good enough that we wouldn’t get ahead of the other by that alone.  It was about understanding the other, and I had the edge there.
    
    The yard was dangerous.  Too wide a space with no cover.  Mary’s space.
    
    That left me the school itself, hallways and classrooms for places I could navigate without exposing myself.  If I made it far enough, then I’d be in the back of the school, with the dorm rooms, showers, kitchen, and the boiler rooms in the basement.
    
    The Lambsbridge gang would be back there, I was fairly certain.
    
    I stopped where I was, beside a classroom door that was already open, something to keep me out of sight while not getting in my way.  The only light that filtered through was from outside, passing through windows on the outside that fit older styles, square and proper and framed, illuminating bits of the classroom, then touching the windows inside the hallways, where it was all broken glass secured in place with custom-grown branches.  The light that reached me was faint and mottled, like the light that might filter through a heavy forest canopy.
    
    I couldn’t move forward until I knew how Mary would react.  Who was she?  How would the others read her, assuming I’d filled them in on the particulars?
    
    She’s dangerous, she prefers to stay at arm’s length.  Throwing weapons, pistol, poison.  It’s not just a fear of you, it’s how she is, I imagined Gordon telling me.
    
    Helen might say something like: The puppeteer raised her with care and a great deal of control.  A special trigger phrase to keep her compliant if she started to slip the leash.  He waited to use it, so it wouldn’t have been a common thing.  Remember everything we said about why he raised them at Mothmont.  Control and a firm hand.  Somewhere he could be close to them and steer them.
    
    Except not in so many words.
    
    Jamie was a hard one for me to guess.  I couldn’t slip myself into Jamie’s shoes and imagine what he’d say because Jamie would be the type to call up some obscure set of details.  He had a good memory, while mine was below average.  But Jamie would also have a sense of the building layout.  He could sketch out a quick map in that book of his, I could stare down at it, put all the pieces together, and start to imagine where Mary might have entered the building, where she might have positioned herself.
    
    I tried to imagine the building as well as I knew it, but it wasn’t a complete map, and parts of it were nebulous, the scale not quite right.  I couldn’t draw a sharp picture, not a crisp image that stayed still in my mind’s eye.
    
    Then there was Lillian.  Not an Academy project, except she was, in a way.  She’d grown up with the Academy in mind, had spent some time at Mothmont, and went on to be one of the Academy’s younger students.  Her family wasn’t so wealthy that she would thrive regardless of what happened.  She’d had to throw herself into her studies, into our activities, just to secure her future.  The Academy had its claws in her.
    
    Lillian would share something about the science of the clones.  Maybe explain how the trigger phrase worked.
    
    …Or, now that I thought about it, she might surprise us and say something very human.  Something like, she was so cold around you, but she let her guard down around him.  She even cried.
    
    I imagined that as the moment I could pull the pieces together and get an idea of where Mary might be lurking.  I could formulate a plan and enact it.  But imagination was only imagination, and as much as it helped to put myself into others’ heads and look at things from set angles, I was missing pieces of it.  Jamie’s map, the extra tidbits that I could never come up with on my own.
    
    But I still had an impression of where Mary was, even if I couldn’t pinpoint the exact location.  Given how much she cared about the puppeteer, how afraid she was of me, there had to be a comfort zone.  A certain range she might wander, where she could potentially keep an eye out for me while still watching him.
    
    My head slowly turned.  End of the hallway.  Either one of the classrooms on either side, the last classrooms at that end of the hall.  Everything beyond that was offices.  More likely to be locked tight, too close to him, not close enough to observe me.
    
    What else?
    
    The yard?  I’d called it her territory.  She could look in the windows just as well as I could look out, and it gave her a lot of range of movement.
    
    I started to imagine a Mary at each of those points.  A phantom image lurking in shadow, just out of sight.
    
    The puppeteer was her weak point.  When he was strong, he could give her strength, centering her.  When he was weak or in danger, she cracked.  The brick I’d thrown at him had been aimed at her, in an abstract way.  That in mind, I was willing to bet that she was devoting more thought to how to protect him than how to catch me if I tried to break away and run.
    
    Strings extended from him to the phantom Marys.  An abstraction of the fundamental hold he had on her.  They were strings that could snap, if given cause, but there was a resistance.  Tension.  Anything she did would always, always be prefaced by a concern for him.  A momentary worry.
    
    That was the tool I had to use.
    
    I could make out a heavy, low sound further down the hallway.  A large object being set down, a book being dropped.
    
    What are you doing, Mary?  I wondered.
    
    The phantom images were suddenly busy.  Enacting various scenes and scenarios.  Mary, anxious, making a mistake.  Mary intentionally making a sound to distract, then slipping closer toward me.  Mary setting a trap, a deadfall or a heavy object that held down a tripwire, impossible to see in the dark.
    
    It was very possible that she didn’t just have weapons.  Poison, wire, any number of things could be stowed away in and around her uniform.  I liked traps, but they were hardly exclusive to me alone.
    
    It was an approach that let her actively protect the puppeteer while keeping the right position respective to me and the man.
    
    If that was what she was doing.
    
    I was visualizing her at the end of the hallway, or in one of the adjacent classrooms.  I wasn’t thinking about the yard.
    
    I raised myself up, head snapping over to look into the window of the classroom beside me, past desks and chairs to the window that looked out into the yard.
    
    Between the rain and the branches, there was no way to tell if she was there, moving around to circle behind me, or if it was just weather and gloom playing tricks with my eyes.
    
    Think twice, Sy, I told myself, going back to thinking about Mary being at any one of the positions in a quarter-circle around me.  Right classroom, hall, left classroom, yard.
    
    This is why Gordon gets on my case, I thought.  Spend too much time thinking, miss my chances.
    
    She was watching, apparently secure in the idea that she’d spot me or confirm my location if I made a break for it.  I needed to disrupt that security.
    
    Need to make a noise someplace I’m not.
    
    I looked, peering into the windows, searching the classrooms around me.
    
    Books could be slid across the floor.  A small object could be thrown to break something, but both were crude, obvious.  I wasn’t strong enough to throw or slide either all that far, the sliding book would make too much noise and the broken glass would be too cliche.
    
    My eye settled on a shape at the back of one room, barely visible as a silhouette against the vague light that made it in from outside, even against the paler background of the wall.
    
    I darted across the hall, low enough to the ground that I had to put my hand down to touch the floor for balance and to keep my nose from smashing into the tile.
    
    My heartbeat picked up as I made it into the classroom, moving amid desks and chairs.  There were windows, yes, but the only exit that didn’t threaten to cut me to shreds on the way through was the door I’d just passed through.  If Mary appeared in the doorway, I might well be done for.  Even if I did make it through a window, I wasn’t sure she couldn’t catch up to me.
    
    The only defense was to do it fast and do it quiet.
    
    I headed to the corner of the room furthest from the door.
    
    Teacher’s desk.  Nothing of importance.
    
    But beside the teacher’s desk, next to the window, there was a globe, resting on a stand, fixed in place at the poles so it could spin.  The colors were rich, even in the gloom.  A third of the globe was dominated by a rich crimson, each etching of place name topped by a crown.  The independent countries were marked out in their own colors, paler, less saturated, scattered and patchwork.
    
    I took it down and pried it free of the stand with the letter opener, then made my way back to the door.
    
    I was paranoid enough of emerging to find Mary standing just outside the door that I raised the globe a bit to shield myself from an impending stab or pistol shot.
    
    But she wasn’t there.
    
    I glanced down the length of the hallway, then set the globe rolling in the direction of a door that sat slightly ajar, leading to a more distant classroom.
    
    I watched it roll, glancing back periodically to make sure she wasn’t sneaking up on me.
    
    It touched the door.  The door moved, creaking slightly, clicking.
    
    I ducked back to cover, hiding just inside a classroom, between the door and the shelf.
    
    Closing my eyes, straining my ears, I counted to twenty.
    
    When the time was up, I took a peek around the corner.
    
    The globe had moved.
    
    I moved in that same heartbeat, toward the globe, low enough to the ground that I couldn’t be glimpsed through the windows, glad for once that I hadn’t grown since I was nine.
    
    As much as I was trying to find her and identify her location, she’d been doing much the same as I had.  I had little doubt she’d watched me break into the school from a window, tracked my general location, maybe even spotted me as I made my way through the school itself.
    
    She had made a sound, but I’d been able to afford staying still.  Not a good thing, not entirely safe, if it was a precursor to her coming after me, but the ball was more in my court.
    
    I’d made a sound, it forced her to react.  Staying where she was risked that I’d go after her ‘brothers’.  Or that I might loop around and find another angle to use in going after the puppeteer.  Or anything.
    
    But seeing the globe, knowing it was a ruse, it forced a decision.  She had to figure out where I really was.  Was it a ruse, or was I leading her one way while slipping through to go after the puppeteer?
    
    Given a fifty-fifty chance with no clue otherwise, the strings pulled her back to the puppeteer.
    
    I passed the globe and the door it had touched, and felt a cool draft.  The excuse for the globe’s movement.  She’d slipped in through the window, had used it to make her exit, or both.
    
    I rounded the corner to the west side of the school, moving as fast as I could toward the dormitories and the Lambsbridge gang.
    
    Even just approaching the boy’s dormitory, I could smell the sickness.  Over a thousand students periodically venting fluids out of every orifice.  Looking through windows, across the corner of the yard, I could see that many lights were on in hallways, though not necessarily in the rooms themselves.  Staff doing patrols and making sure the students were alright.
    
    I couldn’t quite see with the trees in the corner of the yard, but I saw motion.  Fast motion.
    
    The other Lambsbridge members.  Running away or giving chase?
    
    I only had a half-second to make the call, picking up speed, making noise as I ran.  A glimpse through two sets of rain-covered windows, past branches and leaves.
    
    I saw Helen’s eyes, and I saw Gordon’s.
    
    The focus, the killer instinct.
    
    I picked up speed, running faster.  My feet were bare and wet, partially from water that had dripped off the rest of me, and the tile was slick.  I managed to keep my footing, but there were one or two points where I wondered if I was going to slip.  Approaching the bend, where my hallway met theirs at the corner of the dormitory, I could hear them.
    
    As we intersected, I spotted the smallest of Mary’s ‘brothers’, eight or so years old, with two knives in hand.  Red haired, flushed in the face, but with a very cold look in his eyes.  Those same eyes widened as I sprinted his way.
    
    Surprise.
    
    Almost unconsciously, he switched his grip on one knife around, so the blade pointed down.
    
    I dropped to the floor.  Still soaked with the rain, I slid on the tile.
    
    He leaped, to avoid tripping on me, and I grabbed one foot.  It slipped from my grasp, but I’d put him off balance.  He flopped over, belly hitting the floor.
    
    Spry little bastard.  He was already on his feet when Gordon caught up with him.  Without slowing, Gordon slapped one knife-hand to the side, caught the other wrist, and slammed the kid into a wall.
    
    The kid went limp.  Gordon held his wrist, letting him dangle.
    
    The kid’s eyes opened, and he jerked his other knife hand, pointed at Gordon’s middle.  Helen’s foot went out, pinning it against the wall.
    
    “Damn,” the kid said.  I thought I might have seen a glimmer of fear in his eyes, but Gordon hauled him away from the wall, then cracked the kid’s head against it, hard.  He paused, watching, then did it again.
    
    The knives fell from the boy’s hands.
    
    “Lillian, got something to put him under, just in case?”
    
    Lillian did.  She hurried forward, pulling her bag around in front of her to retrieve a syringe.  She squirted out almost half of it before jamming it into the boy’s stomach, depressing it.
    
    “No interrogation?” I asked, as I picked myself up.
    
    “This is the second we caught up to,” Jamie said.  “First was uncooperative enough that I don’t think Gordon is willing to entertain this one.”
    
    As if to explain, Gordon turned and lifted up his shirt.  A bandage was already showing some blood.
    
    Helen and Gordon let the tyke drop to the floor.  Gordon collected the knives, offered one to Helen, who shook her head, then stuck both into his belt.
    
    “They’re better than I am,” Gordon said.
    
    “At?” I asked.  “Fighting?”
    
    He shrugged one shoulder.  “Wouldn’t say that.  Using a knife?  Throwing something?  Definitely better.  Fighting?  Eh.  Brawling?  Definitely not.”
    
    “No real-world knowledge,” Jamie said, looking down at the boy.  He looked up at Gordon.  “No visiting seedy parts of town to trade money or drink for some lessons from the meanest guys around.”
    
    “But they’re still really, really good,” Gordon said.  He looked at me.  “How’d it go?”
    
    “Mr. Percy, our puppeteer, uses sounds to make them compliant if they get antsy,” I said.  “He’s here, with Mary.”
    
    “Percy,” Jamie said.  He paused to consider, then nodded.  “Okay.”
    
    “Attended the academy without being a student.  He knows of the Lambsbridge project, but doesn’t know the particulars.  Still no idea on greater motivation or plans.  He’s hurt, getting medical care.”
    
    “Hurt?” Lillian asked.
    
    “Brick smashed him in the face out of nowhere,” I said.  “Puzzling.”
    
    Gordon was on one knee, searching the little kid.  He collected four knives and a small sack with a weight inside, which he examined.
    
    “Blackjack?” I asked.
    
    “Yeah,” he said.  He tossed it to me.
    
    I gave it a look-see, then pocketed it.  “Our headmistress got a letter in her office, recommending that she call the Academy, discreetly, to ask for a thorough search and examination of the student body, keep everything locked down.  I didn’t expect her to be up and about this early, but it works.  Puppeteer is here, kids are here.  The noose is in place.”
    
    “They only need a push, then,” Helen murmured.
    
    I matched her flat stare with a grin.  “I love you, big sister.”
    
    Her expression unchanged, she reached over to rap the top of my head with her knuckles.
    
    “Ow.”
    
    Gordon tied the kid’s wrists and ankles, then hefted him, folded over one shoulder.  Gordon was big for his age, the kid was small, but Gordon made it look effortless, which was something else altogether.
    
    “Which way?” Gordon asked.
    
    “Mary was that way,” I said, pointing down the way I’d come.  “Puppeteer is in or near the front office.  The third boy is… up to you to figure out.”
    
    He shook his head.  “Last we saw, he was near the kitchen, sent this one after us, we were busy staying out of the way while the little one used all his bullets trying to gun us down.”
    
    “The others had guns?”
    
    “Have,” Jamie said.  “The oldest one has a gun, still.”
    
    I nodded.
    
    Gordon started walking, and the rest of us fell into an easy formation around him.
    
    “Um, have to backtrack a bit, but I wasn’t keeping up with the discussion,” Jamie said.  “You said the quarantine was arranged.  They’re searching the entire student body?”
    
    “Yeah,” I said.
    
    “Us included?”
    
    “Ideal world, we won’t be here,” I said.  “Even if we are, we can adapt.  But I wanted to pressure them, and this does that.”
    
    Jamie frowned.
    
    “Sorry,” I said.
    
    “I’m not good at adapting,” Jamie said.  “Less than you three, anyway.”
    
    “Sly is right, though.  The pressure we’re putting on them is a good thing,” Gordon said.  “That said, the ten year old very nearly killed me, this one was hard enough to keep from slipping away, let alone catch.  Helen wouldn’t put up a fight, and you, Jamie or Lil would die in two seconds flat if any of them got within arm’s length of you.”
    
    We were making our way past the kitchen.  The smell of vomit was thicker here, not just because we were close to the place the poison had first taken hold, but because we were between both dormitories.
    
    “I hate it when people call me Lil,” Lillian said.
    
    I made a mental note of that, storing it for future use.
    
    Gordon did the opposite and apologized, “Sorry, Lillian.  What are we thinking we do with the oldest clone, Mary, and the puppeteer?”
    
    “Separate them, pick them off one by one,” Helen said.
    
    “Mary is devoted to her creator,” I said.  “And the last one-”
    
    “The teenager,” Jamie said.  “Oldest of the clones.  Physically the strongest, presumably the most trained.”
    
    “You don’t have eyes on that one?” I asked.
    
    “No,” Gordon said.  “We’ve glimpsed him, but he was leading this trio.  Keeping his distance.”
    
    I chewed on my bottom lip for a second.  “Doesn’t work.  I don’t see it.  They’re going to band together.”
    
    “I agree,” Gordon said.  “I’m betting he knows his fellows are down, or he will when we turn up.  He’ll stick with Mary, and both of them will stick with their puppeteer.”
    
    “Brothers,” I murmured.
    
    “Hm?”
    
    “They’re Mary’s ‘brothers’, to Mary and the Puppeteer.  Mary is their sister.  It’s a little family unit.”
    
    “I notice you called Helen a sister,” Jamie said.  “Interesting.”
    
    “One isn’t related to the other,” I said.
    
    “I seem to recall you going on at length about the intricacies of the human mind,” Gordon said.  “Everything impacts it on some level or something like that.”
    
    “Okay,” I said, “Whatever.  Let’s joke around about Sy really wanting a family, deep down inside.  Mary’s situation has made me realize it’s what I really want.  It’s a yearning even.”
    
    Hands settled on my shoulder.  Prey instinct, wham.  It took me a moment to realize it was because I saw Gordon, Jamie, Lil, and the smallest clone, but I didn’t see Helen.
    
    Her arms wrapped around my shoulders from behind, and she hugged me tight, before leaning forward to give me a peck on the cheek.  Too perfunctory to be anything serious.
    
    I didn’t move a muscle.
    
    “I’ll be your big sister if that’s what you really want,” she said.
    
    “Sarcasm,” I said, still not moving.  “I’m not sure what we are, but I don’t think ‘family’ is exactly it, and I’m really truly okay with that.”
    
    She pulled away, giving me a rap on the head as she stepped over to Gordon’s side.  I caught a glimpse of a wry smile on her face as she gave me a sidelong glance.  For my benefit.  Her way of letting me know she’d been joking too.
    
    Geez.
    
    “We’re the Lambsbridge orphans,” Gordon said, as Helen leaned against the wall beside him, raising her hand to fix the placement of a strand of hair.  “That’s all we need to be.”
    
    I nodded.  “Yeah.”
    
    “But,” Jamie cut in, “part of being the Lambsbridge Orphans is doing our job.”
    
    “Which brings us back to the ‘how’,” Gordon said.  “You guys think you can hold your own and keep one of them busy while I confront the other?  I’m not sure I can take the older one.”
    
    I shrugged.  “Don’t have to ‘win’.  Assuming the headmistress reached out to the Academy, which I do assume, it’s all a matter of time.”
    
    “What if you’re wrong?” Gordon asked.
    
    “I’m never wrong,” I said.
    
    The sudden burst of protest that came from every corner and every mouth overlapped to the point that I couldn’t pick out individual words.
    
    “Point-” I started.  I was talked over.
    
    I rolled my eyes.  I was pretty sure at least half of them were doing it to try to be funny.
    
    “Point taken,” I managed.
    
    They stopped.
    
    “Get it all out of your system?” I asked.
    
    “It’s late, our sleep was interrupted, we’ve been on edge all week,” Gordon said.  “Thanks for that.  The laugh helped.”
    
    I stuck my tongue out at him.
    
    I studied them.  Most were in uniforms, though Jamie was wearing pyjamas with shoes, an odd combination.  He’d left our room too quickly to get dressed first.  I’d never changed into my pyjamas, myself.
    
    Gordon was hurt, and it showed a little in how he held himself and his expression, and Helen was a little rumpled, though unharmed.  Lil, oddly enough, seemed more together and comfortable than I’d seen her in a long time.  Maybe ever.
    
    She saw me looking and hugged her bag of medical stuff to her chest, glaring at me over the top of it.
    
    “You’re home,” I said.
    
    She didn’t move, but the glare became a more perplexed expression.
    
    “This.  It’s where you belong.  Or the Academy is, and this is a close second.”
    
    She didn’t reply immediately.  Her eyes moved, taking in the surroundings.
    
    “Yeah,” she said.
    
    “Sorry we’re not sticking around for longer,” Gordon said.
    
    “I’m okay being anywhere I don’t have to worry about getting poisoned or stabbed,” Lil said.
    
    “Just an hour or two more,” Gordon said.  “If Sy’s not wrong about the quarantine.”
    
    “Trapping ourselves in here with skilled murderers,” Jamie said, “What could go wrong?”
    
    “Corner the rats and hope they don’t bite too hard,” I said.
    
    “Speaking of,” Gordon said.  His voice had dropped, which helped complete the thought.
    
    We were further from the more lit dorms, now.  In less secure territory.  If we made it around to the front office, I would be very close to having completed a full circuit around the building.
    
    The conversation was, I supposed, our way of touching base, leveling each other out, propping each other up.  Helen was being selective in what she said, letting me know she was glad to have me back in her peculiar way, but she didn’t need reassurance in the same way.
    
    The attitudes of the individual members of the group changed as the surroundings did.
    
    “We got the last two by moving around as a group,” Gordon murmured.  His voice was lowered so he wouldn’t give us away.  “They were trying to keep us away from any place we could arm ourselves or hole ourselves up.  Cornered the first one in the kitchen.  Second one was faking sick.  Jamie figured him.”
    
    I nodded.
    
    “They’re going to be ready for us to come as a group,” Gordon said.
    
    I nodded again.
    
    “We may not be able to keep them from running if they want to run, even if they don’t have a trap.”
    
    I exaggerated my nods until I lost my balance, and bumped into him.  He elbowed me.
    
    “This is serious.”
    
    “Don’t get shot,” I said, echoing Jamie.  “Give me a chance to talk to them.  Mary is off-balance enough I think I can get to her on a level.  She’s pissed because I threw a brick at the man who brought her into this world.”
    
    “That’s harder if they’re all together,” Gordon said.
    
    “I don’t know how up to talking the puppeteer is,” I said.  “Again, brick to face.”
    
    “You keep saying that like you’re proud,” Jamie said.
    
    “It was a beautiful throw.”
    
    “So you are proud,” Jamie said, voice quiet.
    
    “Yeah,” I breathed the word.  “Gordon couldn’t have done better.”
    
    “You’re the filthiest liar,” Gordon murmured, smirking.
    
    “Can we stop talking?” Lil asked.
    
    We obeyed.
    
    The hallway turned, and we came face to face with a scattered group of youths.
    
    Gordon drew a knife, but Helen’s hand reached out, stopping him from going any further.
    
    They were ordinary kids.  Miserable kids in pyjamas who looked like they’d died and been brought back as stitched.  These would be the especially sick ones who needed help, ones who, if the metallic smell to the bodily fluids was any indication, had been so violently ill that blood was involved.
    
    We were near the infirmary.
    
    “Next door on the right,” Jamie murmured.
    
    Gordon gave him a tight nod.
    
    Gordon and Helen edged closer to the door, while I ducked low, to peek past their knees.
    
    Mary, unarmed, standing in the middle of the brightly lit room, ribbons removed, hair in relative disarray.
    
    Gordon was fastest to grasp that something was wrong.  He shoved Helen backward, and Jamie caught her.  I reacted too, backing away, not entirely sure why until Gordon turned the other way.
    
    The room opposite.
    
    A pistol went off, the bullet striking the doorframe where Gordon’s head had been.  It was almost too loud in the hallway where there was nothing to absorb the sound, the sound bouncing off the walls, an echo that played off the ringing in my ears.
    
    The sick children around us screamed, panicking.  They leaped up from chairs and the floor of the hallway.
    
    The screams continued as the children got in our way and obstructed our movements.  One tried to hide between me, clutching the back of my shirt, and made it hard for me to rise to a proper standing position.
    
    It was a moment of stupidity that left me mostly in the front of everything as our third boy stepped out of the room he’d been hiding in, pistol in hand.  He wore a uniform, but he had a cloak and hood on over it, possibly to conceal himself better in the dark.
    
    For all my talk about effective use and prediction of bugs’ movements when the box was shaken…
    
    “Oy!” Gordon shouted.  “Got your kid brother here!”
    
    I saw the hesitation.  The pistol’s barrel slid away from me as his focus turned to Gordon and the youngest clone.
    
    I started to move, ready to kick up and try to knock it away or out of his hand, but the kid behind me still clung to me, and I immediately knew I wouldn’t make contact.
    
    For an instant, I thought we hadn’t accounted for all the clones, but then he made a small sound of fear.  Human frailty, not maliciousness.
    
    Gordon was heading for cover, still carrying his burden, turning his body and running almost sideways so the littlest clone was more between him and the gun-wielder.  The gun moved, wholly focused on Gordon.
    
    One shot rang out, and the clone moved to reload.
    
    Did Mary warn him that I’d said Gordon was most dangerous?
    
    I made my escape, grabbing the kid who’d clutched me and dragging him behind, even though it slowed me down.
    
    The third shot was aimed at me.  It hit the same boy I was trying to rescue, leaving me to stumble as my grip broke.
    
    Helen grabbed me and pulled me around the corner.  We were right at the bend in the hallway where the hallway at the southern part of the school met the long hallway from the eastern part.
    
    The commotion broke up.  The children who’d been sitting there waiting for their turns in the infirmary had mostly fled.  Two were apparently too sick to move while bullets were flying, and the third lay there with a bullet hole in him.  The one who’d clutched me.  Younger than I’d expected, going only by the strength of his grip.
    
    I exhaled slowly.  Gordon was across the hall, in a classroom, ass on the ground, back to the wall, the littlest clone propped up beside him, still unconscious.  The others were behind me.
    
    Unconscious and whatever else.  Being knocked out didn’t mean waking up okay after a set amount of time.  It could mean serious brain injuries.
    
    “I have to ask, for context,” I started.
    
    The pistol fired yet again.  I saw the puff where it had hit the corner.
    
    It was a ball pistol.  One shot, firing balls of lead or whatever else.  It wasn’t efficient, in terms of the number of bullets it spat out, range, velocity, or whatever else.  Where a bullet from a high-end gun passed through your enemy, these guns were meant to fire a small metal sphere into the other guy’s body, where it could bounce around and tear up their insides.  A good killer would make the bullet count, and the damage done by these particular weapons meant that Academy trained doctors would have a far harder time patching them up.
    
    “Context,” I started again.  “Does the Puppeteer read you bedtime stories at night?”
    
    I heard Mary speak, and she sounded very tired.  “Don’t answer.  He’s trying to get to us, or trying to buy time.”
    
    “Oh, Mary!  How are you doing?” I called out.  “They really like using you as bait, don’t they?”
    
    “I volunteered,” Mary said.  “My plan.”
    
    “Funny how that works,” I said.  “You’d think the puppeteer would work harder to convince you that you should stay alive, if you’re that special to him.”
    
    “Puppeteer?” the older clone asked.
    
    “Don’t listen to him,” Mary said.
    
    “You responded,” he pointed out.
    
    “Mm,” Mary said.
    
    I could imagine her expression.  Not very happy.
    
    “I’m curious, Mary, why did you change your mind?  You sounded so insistent about not wanting the puppeteer to put himself in danger by coming here.  Then he said his magic words and, well, can you clarify?  It doesn’t make sense.”
    
    “Magic words,” she said, her voice soft.
    
    “You’re special, Mary, he was going to make something of you, right?  Big sister to all the new clones of the next generation.  Why would he do that, trying to control you?  Maybe if he came out, I could hear his explanation.”
    
    “He’s-” the older clone started.  He stopped short.
    
    I frowned, staring down at the ground, trying to picture why.
    
    “We’re not going to put him in harm’s way,” Mary said.  “You’ll have to get through us to get to him.”
    
    “Basically what I was going to say,” the older clone said.
    
    “He puts you in harm’s way,” I said.  “What part of this is fair?”
    
    “It’s none of your business,” Mary said.
    
    “It’s exactly our business!  It’s what we do.  We do it to make money.  The definition of business.”
    
    I couldn’t see either of them.  I was talking to thin air, which was worse than it had been trying to talk to Mary in the furnace room.
    
    “You’re the cleanup crew for a corrupt and distorted organization.  Child soldiers and killers.”
    
    “I think any argument you could make against our group would apply double for your puppeteer,” I said.
    
    “Think so?  You don’t know us,” Mary said.
    
    Something was off.
    
    For someone recommending avoiding talking to me, she was doing an awful lot of it.
    
    I raised a finger, pointing at the corner of the wall.  Very slowly, I moved my fingertip.  I glanced back at Jamie and Helen, then over to Gordon.
    
    I got nods in response.  They got it.  Gordon leaned back, out of sight.
    
    Mary was distracting us while the other clone approached down the length of the hall.
    
    We didn’t have guns.  Much less guns intended to rip someone up inside.
    
    “I know you, Mary,” I said.  “I get you.  We’re the same.”
    
    She faked a laugh.
    
    I held the blackjack and letter opener, poised to throw the first and stab with the second.  The other clone had to be close.  He could well have his back to the same corner I was crouched beside.  Close enough to smell, if the smell of blood and puke hadn’t made the use of my nose impossible.
    
    “Laughing, you don’t see it?  Tell me, did you have breakfast with him, Mary?” I asked.
    
    “Yes.”
    
    “Often enough?  In the way you really wanted?”
    
    A pause.
    
    Glass shattered.
    
    That was my cue.  I threw myself forward, out into the hallway.
    
    Gordon was still mid-air, having leaped through one of the tree-branch and broken-glass windows that separated classrooms from the hall.  Glass and bits of wood danced around him, his knees pulled up to his chest to clear the wall beneath the window.
    
    Not anything I’d expected, but it was something.
    
    My shoulder hit the ground.  I’d planned to stab if he was close enough.  He wasn’t, so I threw the blackjack.  A little weight in a long, semi-rigid bag for smacking someone over the head.  It served as something to distract, to buy Gordon a fifth of a second as our teenaged assailant reacted.
    
    Gordon collided with him.  In the midst of the collision I saw the two pistols the eldest clone was armed with, saw Gordon reach for just the one, twisting it around in the clone’s hand so the barrel pointed at the boy, the trigger finger slipping away from the trigger.
    
    Our Gordon.  A hero on paper, skilled, strong, fit.  But if anyone took him for noble, they’d be wrong.  A noble person didn’t take advantage of inches of height difference to slam their forehead into someone’s mouth.
    
    The older clone shoved Gordon away.  He raised his pistol in the same instant Gordon did.  One aimed at the other.
    
    Slowly, I found my feet, rising beside Gordon.
    
    The glass had cut him on the way through.  That didn’t happen in the books.
    
    “You had two guns,” Gordon said.
    
    “Was going to shoot both ways,” the clone replied.
    
    “We’re not here for you,” Gordon said.  “We’re here for the puppeteer.”
    
    “That’s not his name,” Mary said.
    
    “It’s a good enough name,” I joined in.  “You can’t deny he has control over you.  He pulls your strings, he decides what you do.  Uses you as bait.”
    
    “And they don’t use you?” Mary asked.  “You’re not tied to them, these other orphans?  Would you give them up to save your skin?  Oh, wait, you don’t care about your skin.  Expiration dates, huh?”
    
    I saw Gordon’s gun waver a fraction.
    
    “Yeah, you forgot to tell them, huh?”
    
    “Was going to at the conclusion of this,” I said.
    
    “You described yourself as a villain.  You’re a liar, a cheat, a thief, a grubby killer.”
    
    “Yet,” Gordon chimed in, “I believe him.”
    
    Mary didn’t have a quick response for that.
    
    “When I was asking about breakfast, about the little things that count,” I said.  “I was really asking if you felt loved, if you truly loved your… father, or whatever you see him as, or if it’s just something ingrained in you.”
    
    “I think that’s my cue?” a voice said.  Not a confident one.
    
    A female voice.
    
    The headmistress emerged behind Mary.
    
    Her hands clutched a piece of paper.
    
    My thoughts moved so fast that they were a jumble.
    
    “La, re, tu, la, sun-”
    
    I found my conclusion.
    
    Left alone with the headmistress, the quarantine, our puppeteer had figured out what I’d done.
    
    “They are not on your side!”  I called out.  “They are not with the Academy, Headmistress!”
    
    He’d turned it around.
    
    “-ro, ta.”
    
    The eldest clone reacted, pulling the trigger.  Gordon’s reaction was a fraction of a second later, off-balance as he reeled from getting hit.  The clone was hit in the shoulder.
    
    The look in his eyes went beyond cold, and had become something else entirely.  Dead, empty, hollowed out.
    
    That was how he had them kill the parents.  A kill phrase, a letter they were to read at a set time or something sent to the home.
    
    Gordon fell, and the clone barely staggered, heedless of pain and injury.
    
    Helen wasn’t a fighter, and the rest of us didn’t stand a chance.
    
    The puppeteer was a manipulative bastard, one that could well be on his way out, and he might well have beat us with one fell stroke."""

    taking_root_11 = """Taking Root one point eleven. Letter opener, get close, stab, doing any damage at all can make the difference, get low, make better use of shorter stature-
    
    The eldest boy stepped closer.  I ducked, drawing my arm back to stab, and he kicked me.  He caught and twisted my wrist while I was trying to catch my balance and before I grasped what he was doing, he’d grabbed the letter opener.
    
    He pushed, and with the way my arm was twisted around, my head pointing forward rather than up, I was put in the position of having to let him destroy the arm or letting myself fall.
    
    I toppled, landing next to Gordon.  He was hunched over, his hand to his chest.  I didn’t like the amount of blood I saw.
    
    Mary was standing back, between me and the Headmistress, who was kneeling on the ground, trying to help the little boy who had been shot, her eyes wide, paper in one hand.  Mary’s expression was unreadable, but her body was tense enough I could visualize every muscle being tight, ready to spring.  The headmistress was the opposite, as if she would have fallen to pieces with a touch.
    
    The others were still around the corner, half-crouching, caught between running and trying to do something.
    
    Helen was the one who stepped up.
    
    We’re better as a group.  Just need to put him off balance, give Helen the best opportunity possible.
    
    I found my feet, half-walking, half-stumbling over to Gordon, where I grabbed one of the knives he’d stowed in his belt.  I paused, behind the clone, watching, waiting for the best chance.
    
    He reached forward, to his belt.
    
    Helen took a step, and I lunged in the same instant.
    
    “Behind you!” Mary called out.
    
    My instincts told me that Helen saw me, that she was capitalizing on the eldest clone’s distraction and my position.  Together, the pair of us might be able to accomplish something, whether he was drawing  a knife or loading his pistol.
    
    But Helen stepped back, instead.
    
    I found myself on a collision course with someone almost twice my size, who was better armed than I was, far better trained.  He followed Mary’s warning by turning and spotting me.
    
    Situations like this were where I felt like the Academy had screwed me over.  The thoughts were in place, I knew what I had to do, and I could see everything play out.  Knife in hand, my enemy’s soft gut in plain view, almost in reach, nothing to stop the knife from punching deep.  Let the pain and the damage done slow him down.
    
    But thoughts ran away, I started naturally thinking about cause and effect, follow-up, what to do to maximize the damage done and turn the situation around.  What if he made that one in a million movement to knock my knife aside with the letter opener or the barrel of the one-shot pistol?
    
    While talking it wasn’t a problem, I could say one thing while thinking about the next step.  A fight moved too fast.  It slowed me down, made it feel like my hands and body were a step behind my thoughts.  Enough to make the difference in a fight against someone ordinary.
    
    This guy wasn’t ordinary.  He swept his arm out, holding the pistol high –more thoughts about complications, predicting what he was doing, countering it– and letting his cloak fan out.  The fabric of the raincloak caught the knife.  His arm moved and helped the cloak naturally fold around the knife and my knife hand.  He bent his arm and used his elbow to force both hand and weapon to one side.
    
    Before I could try to pull away, he was twisting, bringing his knee into my hand, driving it into the wall.
    
    I grimaced in pain and followed through on backing up, aware that I’d lost my knife in the tangle of his cloak.
    
    The letter opener clinked to the ground as he straightened his arm, fixing the flow of his cloak so his own limb wasn’t trapped in the folds.
    
    Before I could catch my balance and pull my thoughts together, he was leaning forward, chasing me faster than I was retreating.  My knife was in one of his hands, freed from the cloak, filling the hand the letter opener had just been dropped from.  The pistol was in his other hand.
    
    Good job, Sy.  Pick a fight, achieve nothing except arming the other guy with successively larger weapons.  Shall we go find a sword to give him?
    
    He kicked me, hard, and sent me stumbling backward.  Keeping me off balance.
    
    I was in the middle of thinking about how to regain it and turn things around when I stumbled over Gordon.  I hit the ground, the back of my head cracking hard against the floor.
    
    One of the best minds the Academy can produce, still no better in a fight than a typical underweight, underdeveloped eleven year old.
    
    I felt a little better knowing that Gordon was now between me and the clone, even if he was crawling on the floor, one hand held tight against a bullet wound, my feet on his back while I lay on the floor.
    
    Then I felt guilty for feeling better.
    
    I shot a quick glance at Mary and the headmistress, and saw that Mary was on the approach.
    
    “Mary,” I said, backing away.
    
    “Don’t even try,” she said.
    
    “Do you want this?  Do you want to be-”
    
    I was cut off by the slam of a door.  The eldest clone had kicked a door that Jamie was trying to use as a shield.  The door closed, and Jamie, Lil and Helen backed up.
    
    “Do you want to be that?”
    
    Her expression was still blank, unreadable.
    
    I knew she had emotions.  I’d seen them, or I’d seen hints of them.  The problem was that she only let herself be vulnerable with her creator.  The same man that had turned his back on her.
    
    She lifted up her skirt at one side and slipped a knife free from a garter.
    
    Gordon moved, straightening, and my feet slid off his back to drop onto the back of his legs.  I pulled them out of the way as he got one foot under him and started to rise up to a standing position.
    
    Mary, for her part, backed off.  Her hand moved at the side of her skirt, and she held another knife.  Smaller, less fancy, and probably weighted for throwing.
    
    “Gordon,” I warned.
    
    He didn’t seem to notice, and he didn’t seem to notice Mary either.  He headed for the older clone.
    
    Mary threw, and in that moment, Gordon stopped in his tracks.  The knife carried onward, striking the wall.  Gordon barely spared Mary a glance before grabbing the knife from the wall and throwing it at the other clone’s back.
    
    The teenaged clone stumbled.  Helen started to move toward him, but he held up his knives, warning her off.
    
    Gordon, for his part, made it another two steps before something refused to support him.  His upper body went askew, seemingly twisted more by pain than anything else, and he stumbled into the wall.  I saw him look at the others, then Mary, then me, a measured study, taking it all in.  His eyes lingered on mine.
    
    One of the first lessons students learn in the Academy, is that life wants to survive.  We’ve been at the survival game for a terribly, terribly long time.  Against hostile environments, against predators.  So long as a student doesn’t work against that impulse, either on the fundamental level or while dealing with the individual, they can trust that life will find a way.
    
    Meeting Gordon’s gaze, I was shocked to see just how hard walking that way was.  His eyes had dark shadows under them as if he hadn’t slept in a week, and his skin was pale, his pupils narrowed.  Each breath he took was laborious, the sort of ragged hauls for breath I’d expect someone to take after being underwater for minutes, but they each came right on the back of the last, with a phlegmatic cast to it, prompting his entire body to jerk a little, as if something kept getting stuck and coming unstuck as he strained himself.
    
    Best of the best, I thought.  I want to take your place, so you don’t have to do this.
    
    Gordon didn’t seem to be up to talking.  He looked at Mary, who was reaching for another throwing weapon, and spread his arms to either side, stepping away from the wall.
    
    “I wouldn’t,” I told Mary, which was the truth.  Then I lied, “When he’s like this he’ll just catch them out of the air.”
    
    Though her expression was blank, I saw the pause in her follow-through.  A moment of doubt.
    
    Gordon pushed himself away from the wall, taking advantage of the bend in the hallway to escape Mary’s throwing range and advance on the clone he’d thrown a knife at.
    
    I saw Mary grab the knife and hurried to duck into the classroom where the youngest clone had been propped up against a wall.
    
    She didn’t throw the knife.
    
    Gordon drew closer to the clone he’d knifed.  Both were injured, Gordon suffering from a gunshot that had very possibly danced around the inside of his torso, the clone shot in one shoulder and knifed in the back.
    
    The clone, however, seemed largely immune to pain, the killing phrase driving him past such mundane things, putting him in the mind for efficient aggression and murder and nothing else.  He was using his wounded shoulder to a reasonable extent, a stark contrast to Gordon, who wasn’t using one arm while he held a hand against his injury, though both arms were in good working order.
    
    Our clone had about three inches and twenty-five pounds on Gordon, who was already of a good size.
    
    To top it off, it seemed he had a pistol and the wherewithal to use it.  While Gordon limped his way, he drew a pellet out of his pocket and slipped it into the gun’s chamber, pulling at the lever along the barrel.
    
    Helen appeared behind the clone, doing exactly what I’d intended when I’d come up behind him, earlier.  She caught the clone’s arm as Gordon drew closer, hauling it back and forcing the pistol off course.  I ducked lower in the wake of it going off, though I knew that by the time I heard the thing it was already too late.
    
    I saw a flurry of movement as Helen scrabbled for a grip on him, only to get elbowed once, kicked, and slashed at by the knife.
    
    Gordon collided with him, keeping him from doing anything further.
    
    They’re still nascent, I thought. Gordon was still undeveloped.  Still young, largely untrained.  Our exercises and adventures in the ass-end of Radham weren’t sanctioned, but weren’t discouraged either.  Gordon had been hungry to put his brain to work, and he’d done it to good effect.
    
    I’d been less hungry, more desperate, but my own studies at the back-alley brawl had been far less effective.  I’d stuck it out for far too long before the others had stopped letting me come.
    
    Gordon had put himself chest-to-chest with the clone.  It wasn’t pretty, it wasn’t fancy.  It was exactly what he needed to do to reduce the effectiveness of the skills the clones had learned in the ring.
    
    This was how he operated, and this was how he thought.
    
    The Academy hadn’t gone out of their way to make him especially tough, but they’d given him a good head and a good body and that counted for something.  They had, however, equipped him so he would pick up the skills he needed and master them faster than most.  Part of having a good head and a good body was that he had the coordination between both, no matter the situation, moving and thinking quickly with neither suffering for the other.
    
    Knives were terrible weapons, and our two brawlers each had one.  They were messy things, messier when the one wielding them was good, and both fighters here were good. Tentative slashes were fended off, hands of one boy gripping the wrists of the other, to try and limit the movement of the knives, but even the chance cuts were gruesome, parting skin. Blood dripped from Gordon’s chest wound to the floor now that he was no longer holding his hand there.
    
    I yelped a little as I saw Gordon take a knife in the side.  I saw him bring one arm down, away from the clone’s wrist, pinning the knife in place.  With the slickness of the blood and Gordon’s sheer tenacity, the clone couldn’t pull it free.
    
    Gordon, for his part, still practically hugging his enemy, was able to stab several times, despite the clone’s efforts to keep his arm still.
    
    This is the puppeteer’s mistake.  Take away something’s will to continue on, no matter how strong it is, no matter what else you do, you create a losing battle.
    
    The clone didn’t try to stop Gordon, instead striking out with hands, striking at head, ears, even at Gordon’s bullet wound.
    
    But Gordon kept stabbing, and soon reached the point where the clone wasn’t resisting as the knife went in and out of his midsection.  The clone soon dropped, and Gordon went with him, having been leaning so heavily on him for support.
    
    Jamie and Lil went immediately to his side, looking after Gordon while dealing with the dying clone.  Helen, badly cut, didn’t move from where she’d fallen, but a glance suggested Lil had given her some preliminary care.  All three of them were around the corner from Mary and the headmistress.  Joining them meant crossing the breadth of the hallway.  I decided that wasn’t too wise.
    
    “Mary,” I said.
    
    I didn’t get a response.
    
    I glanced out of the hallway, then pulled my head back as I saw a flurry of movement, out of the corner of my eye.  A knife hit the doorframe.
    
    I tried to grab it, found I didn’t have the strength to pull it away where it had embedded into the wood, removed my hand, and saw another hit the spot where my hand had just been.
    
    “It’s over, Mary,” I said.  “What are you even doing?”
    
    “I’m doing what the Academy needs me to do,” she said.  “Protecting the children of this school.  I just… I have to buy time and make sure you don’t get away, before the quarantine.”
    
    “What are you even talking about?” Jamie asked.
    
    I raised a hand, urging Jamie to hold back.
    
    “Mary,” I said.  “Forget the headmistress.  As pawns go, she’s mostly used up.”
    
    “Pawn?” I heard the woman utter the word.  Outrage had pushed her to speak where she’d been caught up in silent horror, watching children shoot, stab, and use weapons on each other, spattering her school hallway with blood.
    
    I ignored her.  “Where do you go next, Mary?  The puppeteer is gone.  He left the headmistress with a paper that was supposed to turn you into weapons, presumably one by one.  Something about that tells me he didn’t plot a way for you to meet again.”
    
    “I’ll do what I’m supposed to do, and then I’ll find him,” she said.
    
    “Oh, you want to prove your worth, after being discarded?” I asked.  “Prove that you worked as an experiment?  He’ll be so overjoyed at how good you are that he takes you back in with open arms?”
    
    “Something like that.”
    
    “Oh come on, Mary,” I said.  “Come on.  I bet I’m describing almost exactly what you’re hoping for.  You don’t care about the boys, this kid who’s unconscious next to me, or the big guy that just got carved up by Gordon.  You just figured you’d stand there and let them throw themselves at us, do as much damage as possible, and then you’d clean up.  Go back to the puppeteer as the one who succeeded.”
    
    There wasn’t a response.
    
    “Thing about you being created for one thing and one thing only, you’re pretty easy to figure out.  You have a reality and the puppeteer is at the center of it.  You’re trying very hard to avoid thinking about what it means, that he went out of his way to plug a special sequence of sounds into your head, and set it up so that you’d kill.  The lies, the basic underlying thought process that he had from the beginning.  What he’s doing right this moment, leaving you… and what lies in the future.  Even in your perfect hypothetical world, what happens?”
    
    Still no response.
    
    “Let’s say you kill each of us.  Gordon’s dead, Helen can’t fight so effectively, Jamie’s almost as bad in a scrap as I am.  Then you go to him, and he welcomes you with open arms.  But you know he’ll have his doubts.  He knows you know that he abandoned you.  What you are.  Can you picture the tense conversation, the rules he sets in place so you don’t go running the mouth and filling in the next generation of clones?  How grim is that life, the two of you never speaking about what happened tonight, and how things changed?”
    
    She was still silent.
    
    I frowned.  Did I lose her?  Had she slipped away?
    
    “The reality of existence, of life, in every sense of the word, Academy or literal or figurative, is that things change.  Nothing is static.  Your relationship to the puppeteer has changed, and-”
    
    I chanced another look out into the hallway.
    
    I thought I saw a movement, and flinched, ducking back.
    
    When no knife appeared, I looked again.
    
    There was only the headmistress, clutching her hands in front of her.  I saw her eyes move.
    
    To the broken window.  After Gordon had come into the classroom with the littlest clone, he’d made a dramatic exit-
    
    And Mary had made a silent entrance.
    
    I scrambled to move out of the way.  The knife that hit the door wasn’t a throwing weapon.  Larger, burlier around the handle.  She’d still managed to throw it hard enough and accurately enough that the blade stuck in the wood.
    
    She came through the aisle of the dark classroom, ducking low, a weapon in each hand.
    
    I didn’t need to see anything more.  I escaped into the hallway.
    
    Jamie’s eyes widened as he looked over my shoulder.
    
    Before his mouth was even open, I was reacting to the warning he was about to communicate.  No overthinking possible in this, at least.  ‘Get out of the way’ was a ‘get out of the way’, and it didn’t need to be fancy.
    
    I turned, and in the process I fell awkwardly against the corner where the two hallways met.
    
    Mary stopped in the doorway, looking at all of us.  She had one knife in hand.  The other hand was empty, clenched.
    
    Her facade was slipping.  There was emotion in her eyes.  Anger, hatred.
    
    Many of us were beaten, battered, and bruised.  Jamie and Lil had avoided more than a few simple scuffs, but Gordon, Helen and I had taken our individual beatings, roughly in that order.
    
    I wasn’t so sure we could put up a fight.  Especially if she played it clever.
    
    “Don’t say it,” Mary said.
    
    Don’t say what?  I thought.  My memory wasn’t that good, for me to know what she was referencing.
    
    But whatever it was, it was something I’d said that had stuck with her, something she was afraid I’d say.
    
    I offered her a sympathetic expression, while my brain raced to try and piece it together.
    
    The sympathy hurt her.  It made her fist clench tighter.  I’m pegging her wrong, I realized.  The anger, hatred, and fear all stemmed from something else, flowing from a source that ran deeper and left more painful wounds.
    
    Need.
    
    “I won’t say it, then,” I told her.  “But put the weapon down.”
    
    “I can’t,” she said.
    
    “There’s nothing left for you here.  If you hold on to it, whatever futures flow from there, they-”
    
    I saw her flinch.
    
    “…I said I wouldn’t say it,” I told her.
    
    “And you’re a villain,” she said.  “A liar.  Just say it.  Out with it.  Say it, or I will.”
    
    “Alone,” I said.  “If you move forward, you’ll be alone.”
    
    Her head snapped to one side.  I saw the pain in her expression.  The facade was broken, the vulnerability exploited and trampled.
    
    “Headmistress,” she said.
    
    Oh no.
    
    “Headmistress!” I called out.  “No, nope, don’t listen to her!”
    
    “Read it,” Mary said, pointing.
    
    “Don’t!” I called out.
    
    I saw the indecision on the headmistress’ face.
    
    In the midst of a situation she didn’t comprehend in the slightest, she held the means to turn Mary into the weapon, a mad, reckless one, but one we might not be able to properly fight.  For Mary, though, it was an escape.
    
    Something to take the dissonance and simplify it.  Reduce everything to one basic, self-destructive impulse.
    
    “If you don’t,” Mary said, “They’ll kill us both and escape before the Academy gets here to draw up the quarantine.”
    
    That seemed to be the needed push.
    
    “Mary,” the headmistress said.
    
    I couldn’t step forward without Mary lashing out.  Couldn’t run and leave the others.  A few sounds, and we were utter goners.
    
    I needed to convince the headmistress.
    
    But I couldn’t think of the words to do it.  If I could figure out what the puppeteer had said, the line of logic… professing to be from the Academy, maybe, a long-time plant, protecting the students.
    
    Start with what I knew she knew.
    
    “The office was locked,” I said.  “Doors and windows.  The letter was signed in blood.  Look, blood!”
    
    I showed her my hands where the thorns had injured them.
    
    She didn’t even flinch, glancing up, then back to the paper.
    
    “Yu du-”
    
    Notecard, cards, pen-
    
    Letter opener.
    
    “Letter opener!” I called out.  “Your letter opener.  I have it from when I left the note!”
    
    “Nah-” She stopped partway.  I saw a blink.  The moment where she wondered.
    
    I pointed, but Jamie had already noticed the letter opener.  Before I’d even recalled exactly where it fell, he was sliding it over the tiles.
    
    I stopped it with my foot, then kicked it toward the headmistress.
    
    It stopped a few feet away from her.
    
    “It’s yours.  I know it’s yours.  But I have it.  Think.  Why would the Academy shoot and hurt your other students?”
    
    My eyes fell on the one student who had been shot.  The one I’d helped into the line of fire, letting him take a bullet for me.  The headmistress looked down at him.  Her own hands were bloody from trying to staunch the flow of blood, though his stillness suggested it was too late, the damage done.
    
    She let the bloodstained paper fall to the floor.
    
    It was as if the words had been read, all the same.  Mary charged, mindless or unwilling to think, knife in hand.
    
    I ran, but Mary was taller, and she wasn’t running backward.
    
    She closed the distance, knife ready.
    
    I knew escape was impossible, futile.
    
    But I reached the others, where Helen had joined Jamie and Lil.
    
    I grabbed Helen and, before she could react, thrust her in Mary’s general direction.  It wasn’t a very good thrust, but it served.
    
    Better her than me.
    
    Helen winced as the knife pierced her side or back.  Mary raised the knife up to Helen’s throat for what would have been a quick and terminal cut, and Helen caught the hand, stopping the blade before it could make contact.
    
    Mary settled for taking her hostage.  She was breathing harder than the momentary exhaustion justified.  I imagined her thoughts were chaos and noise and pain.
    
    “Alone,” she said.  “That’s what you said?”
    
    “Yeah,” I said, my voice soft.
    
    “Acting like this, throwing allies away when it suits you, I think you’re going to end up more alone than I am.”
    
    I nodded slowly.  “Maybe.”
    
    “You’re despicable.”
    
    “Never denied that.”
    
    “No right to say anything to me.”
    
    I watched Helen tighten her grip on Mary’s wrist.
    
    “I already said most of it,” I said.  “We’re works in progress.  Helen, Gordon here, Jamie, even me, in a lesser way.”
    
    I saw Mary’s expression change.  She raised a hand to try and pry Helen’s hand loose, but Helen grabbed her other wrist.  The knife strained to move, but Helen didn’t let it.
    
    Helen wasn’t a fighter, but that wasn’t to say she wasn’t strong.
    
    “Helen isn’t really an actress.  Well, she is, but that’s not the end result.  I planted that seed, reinforced an idea you had already.”
    
    Helen rolled her shoulders, and I could see movements beneath her school uniform, as bones shifted and found new configurations.  Her limbs moved in ways they shouldn’t have, joints bending the wrong way.
    
    I looked to one side as Helen raised one leg up, over her own shoulder, and wrapped the foot around the back of Mary’s neck.  Had I been looking, I would have seen up Helen’s skirt, and that would have been rude of me.
    
    Mary made a sound as her struggles failed to make progress.
    
    I walked past them, still averting my gaze, and approached the headmistress.
    
    “Go,” I said.  “Take the boy and go.”
    
    I saw the confusion and fear, and the momentary relief at having an escape.  She fled, carrying the boy in her arms.
    
    “Back in the furnace room, I mentioned Doctor Ibott.  You cut me off before I could say more about him.  See, he’s the one who handled Helen.”
    
    I saw confusion join alarm on Mary’s face.
    
    “But-” Mary started.  She didn’t get further. Helen raised her other leg, and the shift in weight made Mary tip forward.  Helen snapped her leg around, taking advantage of the fall to slip herself around behind Mary.  Arms moved and twisted, and at the end of it, Helen was on top of Mary, who was face-first on the ground.  Mary’s arms were caught beneath and in front of her, Helen’s hand around hers, forcing her to hold the knife at her own throat.
    
    Every muscle and bone seemed to be straining in the wrong ways against Helen’s skin.  It conjured up ideas of an insect, or a starved jungle cat, perched atop its prey.
    
    “But Ibott only does big things.  Monsters that can win wars.  Juggernauts and ship sinkers.  Well, the guy who heads our project poked at Ibott’s pride, and got Ibott to do something smaller and cleverer.  Helen’s the only one of us who isn’t human, you know.  Vat grown, like you, but built from scratch.  She’s only an actress because she had to learn from the beginning.”
    
    Mary made a strangled sound.  Helen was choking her, staring down at her with a blank expression.
    
    I bent down, and I picked up the bloodstained paper the headmistress had dropped.
    
    I read it.
    
    “We’re works in progress.  Helen’s still growing into her role.  The femme fatale.  A little odd when she’s still a child, but she’ll be something when she’s older.”
    
    I glanced over at Mary, who was struggling and failing to escape Helen’s embrace, then folded up the paper and stuck it in my waistband.  I reached for Mary’s file folder, and withdrew a paper.  I’d thought I’d use it to compare notes if I could find Percy’s place and break in, but this would do.
    
    I reached down and touched the bloodstain where the shot child had fallen.  I gripped the paper, crumpling it in my hands.
    
    “Let her go, Helen.”
    
    Helen did.  When she let go of Mary’s hand, Mary let go of the knife.  Helen collected it.
    
    Mary didn’t move as I approached.  The fight was gone out of her.
    
    I held the bloodstained paper.
    
    Then I tore it, slowly, for dramatic effect, into very small pieces.
    
    I let the pieces fall in front of Mary.
    
    “It’s your call,” I said.  “Fight to the death like he wanted, or stick it to him.  Join us.”
    
    It took a long time before she found the courage to nod.

    I sat in the rain, watching the Academy’s students gather around the school.  Individual members of our teams had come, looking after their projects and keeping us from being discovered, and I was enjoying the fact that Lacey was here for me and unable to find me.
    
    My fingers unfolded the paper I’d collected.  The puppeteer’s note.  Instructions to the headmistress, useless.  The kill command for a dead clone, useless.  And his command to Mary, which was an interesting puzzle I’d have to work out in the future.  Something to discuss with Hayle.
    
    Mary.  You do not have a command like Clyde does. 
    
    I won’t say I didn’t try, but only managed to induce short fits to reset your mind. 
    
    I grew fond of you, I admit.  What I told you was not lies.  If it comes down to it and Clyde fails, run.  Find your way.
    
    I will find you.  We will be together, and we will succeed.

    taking_root_12 = """Taking Root one point twelve. Down on the street, I could see the others making their way to a coach.  Lacey’s body language changed, as she craned her head, looking in the direction of the Academy.  She asked a question, and Jamie pointed to the Academy.  Lacey hesitated, then headed indoors.
    
    I started my descent the moment she was gone.  Out to the front face of the building, down the branches, touching the street.  For all that the ‘quarantine’ was in effect, students forming a loose circle around the school, one team erecting a tent near the entrance, I wasn’t spotted.
    
    Getting past the perimeter that was in progress was another story.
    
    Walk with confidence, as if you don’t expect to get caught.  Be small, take advantage of your size.
    
    People didn’t want to disturb norms.  If one looked like they fit into the greater scheme of things, then it took a kind of courage to step away from the herd and stand out, challenging that.  Doubly so when schools or the Academy were involved.
    
    It was often easier to avoid the attention of ten people than it was to avoid the attention of one.  Even scratches, bumps, bruises, and being soaked to the bone became invisible if one had the poise.
    
    “Hey, you,” one of the students called out as he intercepted me.
    
    Apparently I don’t have the poise. 
    
    I suppressed a sigh.  I pitched my voice just a bit higher, my eyes wide.  “I’m supposed to be in my dorm.  What’s going on?”
    
    “You’re not- you were coming in the other direction.”
    
    “You let me walk by you,” I said, a little breathless, panicky, “then I got scared because there are so many people and then I turned around and I’m supposed to be in my dorm, why, what’s going on?”
    
    “We didn’t let you walk by us,” one said.
    
    “You did!” I said, in the tone that only children could pull off.  One hundred percent certainty.  Adults learned to doubt themselves, but a child could truly believe.
    
    I saw the doubt on their faces.  I latched on it.  “You let me walk by just now.  Why are you lying?”
    
    “We-”
    
    “Why?” I asked, cutting him off.  Keep him off balance.
    
    I saw the glance, the shift in his gaze.  His lips parted, about to speak.
    
    “You-” I started.
    
    But he ignored me, reaching for my hand, hauling it up and away from my pocket.
    
    “You’re bleeding,” he said.
    
    Drat.
    
    Just my luck, I couldn’t get an Academy student who was in it for the power or prestige.  He had to care about the profession.
    
    Bully for him, it probably made him a more effective student in the long run, but it didn’t help me right now.
    
    “He’s with me,” I heard a voice state, behind me.
    
    I cringed a little, glancing back.  Lacey, who had one hand on her hip.
    
    “That doesn’t mean anything to me,” the student said.
    
    “I know him.  He’s mentally unsound and a challenge to deal with.  The blood on his hands is his own fault.  He got away from his caretaker, and I need to get him back now.”
    
    Dirty pool, Lacey, I thought.  I looked up at the student, my eyes wide, my lips now slightly parted, tongue visible between my teeth.  Nothing obvious, but still playing along.
    
    “If he was in the school-”
    
    “He was telling the truth,” Lacey said.  She put a hand on my shoulder.  “You let him walk right by you.  I’ll vouch that he wasn’t anywhere near the sensitive areas, and I’ll stay quiet about your lapse.  If you don’t make us miss our coach.”
    
    The student glanced over at the coach where the others were already getting seated, then stepped out of the way.
    
    Lacey guided me, her grip on my shoulder a little firmer than it needed to be.  Rather, she was digging her fingernails in as if she thought I was going to run away.
    
    We made our way to the coach.  Gordon was apparently in another coach, being looked after by a few of the collected students assigned to our projects, but Helen, Jamie, Mary and Lil were inside the waiting coach.  Lil had an empty syringe in hand, and Helen was occupying the whole bench beside her, head on Lil’s lap, eyes partially closed.
    
    No adults sat inside.
    
    “You came back pretty quick,” Jamie spoke to Lacey.  “Second thoughts?”
    
    “I find that when I’m dealing with Sylvester, directly or peripherally, and I have the little doubt in the back of my mind, I have to take a moment and second guess what I’m doing.  I didn’t expect it from you, Jamie.”
    
    “Sorry,” Jamie said.  “I thought he’d come down if you left.”
    
    “I thought as much.  I asked myself, what is the most inconvenient thing he could do?  Making me search the school for him, only to find the coach was gone when I step outside.”
    
    I shrugged my way free of her claw-grip and climbed up into the coach.
    
    “Goodbye, Sylvester,” Lacey spoke to my back.
    
    I collapsed into the cushioned seat and looked her way, an eyebrow raised.  The goodbye felt meaningful.  Her expression was dead serious, driving that idea home.
    
    “I thought about what you said,” she told me.  “I don’t know what to say except that you’re right.  You win.  I’ve asked to be taken off your project.  Professor Hayle agreed.”
    
    I nodded.  I was very aware that Mary was watching this exchange between Lacey and I.
    
    “I want to make excuses, justify, argue, give any one of a number of responses.  But I’m doing it for my sake, if I remember right, not for yours.  I guess the only thing I have left to say is that it’s your loss in the end, Sylvester.  You need people who know you and your history.  How you’ve developed, how you operate, what you need.”
    
    “Maybe,” I said.  “But I also need the autonomy to decide who I work with.  You say you know me, you get how I operate, in a lot of ways.  You see that as a good thing, but it’s the opposite for me.”
    
    She gave me a long, hard look.
    
    “Goodbye, Sylvester,” she said, for the second time.
    
    “Goodbye, Lacey,” I said.
    
    She shut the door to the coach.
    
    A moment later we were in motion, on our way to the Academy.
    
    No chaperones, which felt odd.  Was that Hayle’s call?  Someone else’s?  It was convenient, but if Mary decided to strangle me with the chain, I wasn’t sure how good of a fight we’d put up in these tight quarters.
    
    She sat just to my right, and she was completely silent.  A little damp, now, rumpled, her ribbons gone, hair loose and in need of a combing.  Her wrists were shackled, the shackles themselves thick and heavy, with proper chains that a bull couldn’t have broken.  A blanket was draped over her lap, but the outline was unmistakeable.
    
    She’d been disarmed, though I doubted everything had been collected.  She was too careful.
    
    Too delicate right now.  I couldn’t poke or test her.  Dangerous.
    
    I turned to look away, and saw Jamie was writing in his notebook.
    
    Not writing.  Sketching.
    
    My face, looking in Mary’s general direction.
    
    The pen went still.  When I looked up from the pen’s tip, Jamie was staring at me.
    
    “What?” I asked, uncomfortable.
    
    “That was nice of you,” he said.
    
    “I’m never nice.”
    
    “You’re a damn liar, and you’re lying about not being nice,” Jamie said.  “You messed with Lacey-”
    
    “Which is very not nice,” I pointed out.
    
    “-And you told her why you did it,” Jamie said.
    
    “I told her it was because she pitied me and pretended to be nice, which wasn’t wrong.”
    
    “You’ve handled worse without flinching,” Jamie said.  “You just gave her the real reason.”
    
    I closed my eyes and let my head move back until it hit the padded back wall of the coach.  The wall vibrated with the movement of the wheels over the road.
    
    When I heard the scratch of the pen on paper, I chanced a look at Jamie’s work.
    
    The sketch was left unfinished, but was being captioned.  ‘Sly, after a rare moment of kindness.’
    
    I rolled my eyes and closed them.
    
    Two mistakes in a relatively short span of time.  Getting caught by the student at the quarantine perimeter, and how I’d dealt with Lacey.  I was tired, my brain too active for too long.  I was starting to stumble.
    
    Except the night wasn’t quite over yet.
    
    “Someone’s gone ahead, we should have an escort when we arrive,” Jamie commented.  “For our passenger.”
    
    I gave Mary another look, and saw her looking outside the window.  Watching the rain-soaked city pass us by, the lights, the streetlamps, and rare figure standing in the dark.
    
    Was one of them the puppeteer?
    
    Her mind was roaming, her thoughts escaping the confines of the coach to focus on what lay beyond, very possibly dwelling on the puppeteer.
    
    “Helen,” I said.
    
    Mary startled at the sound of my voice, or because it was Helen that I named?
    
    “Yes?” Helen asked.
    
    “Do you have a comb?”
    
    She produced a small comb from a shallow pocket in her uniform dress.  Rather than make her move, I rose from my seat and took it from her hand, before letting myself fall hard against my cushioned seat.
    
    I held it up for Mary.  “So you can feel more like yourself.”
    
    “I don’t know who myself is,” she said, but she took the comb and began working it through her hair.  There were more than a few tangles that required sharp, violent tugs to figure out.
    
    Couldn’t push too hard.  Just had to make sure she was grounded, focused on us.
    
    “For now, let’s get through tonight,” I said.  “I don’t think any of us want you chained up.  Except maybe you.”
    
    She snapped her head around, looking offended.
    
    Because I’d crossed a line, or because I was right?
    
    “You just said you don’t know who you are,” I said.  “Are you, right this minute, someone who wants to be chained up?  Saying yes or no doesn’t mean betraying him or threatening your standing with us.  It’s about who you are in this moment.”
    
    She made a face, looking out the window at the city once more.
    
    “Sy?” Lil asked.
    
    “Yes, Lil?” I replied, my response as syrupy as I could make it.
    
    I saw the annoyance on her expression, but it didn’t distract her from what she was going to say: “Don’t be a butt.  Leave her alone.”
    
    The statement was forceful enough to catch me off guard.  Surprise gave way to annoyance.  How about you trust me to know what I’m doing?
    
    But Jamie must have seen something in my expression, because he gave me a light tap with his elbow.
    
    Fine.
    
    Fine.  I wasn’t entirely on the ball, either.  I was positive I wasn’t crossing the line, but that didn’t mean I couldn’t make more minor mistakes.
    
    I gave Lil a smile, then let my head rest against the cushion.
    
    “Do you want me to patch you up?”  Lil offered.  “Your hands look bad.”
    
    A conciliatory gesture?  She couldn’t recant what she’d said, but maybe she hadn’t meant it to come out as forcefully as it had.  Fatigue affected her, too.  Emotions were a drug with their own side effects, ebbs and flows, and after half a night of activity and a week of fearing for her life, she might not have been on point any more than I was.
    
    “They’ll want to look us over anyway,” I said, closing my eyes.  “It’d be redundant.  Relax instead, look after Helen.”
    
    Lil looked down, where Helen was sleeping.  Tranquilized.
    
    We were silent as the coach made its way through the streets, the stitched horses keeping up their hard patter of hoofbeat on roadtop.
    
    We reached the Hedge, and there was more light there, less space between streetlights and streetlamps.  A glance out the window showed the perimeter wall, lit up by the ambient light.  It seemed to say ‘The Academy: A glowing beacon at the edge of Radham.’
    
    Through a gate, and into the Academy proper.  We passed the Rows, Claret Hall, and the Rise, heading straight for the Tower.
    
    Mary was tense.  Her shoulders were stiff, and she’d moved enough to make the chain move since the journey had begun.
    
    Here we are.
    
    “You’ve been here before,” I said.
    
    Mary snapped her head around, as if unsure who I was talking to.  I wasn’t sure who she expected it to be, but she seemed to figure out that I was talking to her.  “Visits.”
    
    “That’s all this is.  A visit.”
    
    “One that decides my fate,” she said.
    
    I shrugged, slow.  “Maybe.  Is that why you’re so anxious?  Or is it something else?”
    
    “You keep talking like you read my mind,” she said.
    
    You’re more of an open book than the literal open book in Jamie’s lap.
    
    “It’s not hard to figure out.  You were told we’re the enemy.  We’re the bad guy.  Visits were visits.  You knew where you stood.”
    
    “Sure,” she said, the word curt.
    
    “They’re going to want to talk to you, ask questions.  Be ready for it.  You don’t have to tell them everything, but anything you tell them will smooth things over.  I don’t have anywhere to be, so I’ll be with you until we figure out where things stand.  I’m your ally, your advocate, I offered you a place with us, I will make it happen.  I promise things will be okay.  ”
    
    “Promise,” she said.  Not a question, not a statement, only an echo.
    
    Did the word have a significance?
    
    “Do they even agree with you?” she asked.
    
    They?  The other Lambsbridge orphans?
    
    “I trust Sy,” Jamie said.
    
    “Yes,” Helen murmured.  She’d sensed the coach slowing down, and had roused.
    
    I glanced at Lil, and sensed the hesitation.  Mary would too.
    
    But Lil said, “Yes.”
    
    Mary’s expression didn’t change.  Not deadpan, like Helen’s; it was a vaguely lost, heartbroken look that she had about her, and it was a look that didn’t offer any tells.
    
    It suggested she was more comfortable or certain about what was going on than she had been a moment ago, when all the walls had been down and in ruins.
    
    The coach stopped, and we made our way out, Lillian removing the blanket that covered Mary’s shackles, clumsily folding it and dropping it on the spot where Helen had been lying.  One by one, we made our way out, passing the Stitched bodyguards on either side of the door.
    
    When Mary reached the door, they seized her.
    
    “Go easy,” I told them.  “She’s not a threat.  You can stay close, but don’t manhandle her.”
    
    The handlers for the two stitched bodyguards echoed my orders.  The two bodyguards let go of Mary, leaving her free to follow a pace behind me.
    
    We were on dry ground.  At the base of the Tower, a roof had been set up so one side rested against the Tower itself, the other side propped up by a row of custom-grown trees.  Stitched horses were lined up beneath, with cords and wires stringing them up to a rack of large metal cables that ran down one side of the tower.
    
    Gordon was already out of the other coach, lying in a stretcher, with the team that worked on the Griffon project surrounding him.
    
    Three students looked after me.  Two, now that Lacey was gone.  Nine looked after Jamie.  Lillian had special tutoring and attention from a set of teachers, giving her support and care.  Helen stood alone with no students or teachers to maintain and look after her, each one getting driven away in time, but she did have her black-coat professor.
    
    Twelve individuals looked after Gordon, and nine of those individuals were present, walking in a group around, ahead of, and trailing behind him as the stretcher was wheeled into the tower.  I was willing to bet that more were inside.
    
    The rest of us almost didn’t matter, while they were focused on their subject.  Debating and discussing ways to move forward, consulting lists and charts.
    
    He was in their hands.  I wasn’t too worried about how it would turn out.
    
    As they filtered away, we were left in the company of a few scattered students who stood closer to the Tower’s entrance.  I recognized some as members of Jamie’s team, two men and two women who looked a little more tired than all the rest.  I also spotted the two remaining members of my team, two men who were standing to one side, smoking.  Behind us were the students who managed the stitched guards.
    
    “I didn’t realize how badly I was outnumbered,” Mary said.
    
    I smiled at the notion.
    
    She didn’t smile back.
    
    “It’s the Academy,” I said.  “This is a small department with a shortage of funding.  You should see the manpower backing the other projects.”
    
    Lillian, Jamie, Helen, Mary and I ventured closer.
    
    “Jamie,” one of Jamie’s project workers said.  Older than the rest.  “Uh, a few questions, first, but Professor Hayle wanted to see her.  Everyone’s to have their checkups, appointments, and testing.  If you could give us a moment with Jamie-”
    
    “Have your moment,” I said, cutting him off.  “No rush.”
    
    My two remaining team members were Dewey and Alton, puffing away at cigarettes.  Take away the white coats, and they could have passed for street toughs who were waiting to hold me at gunpoint and force me to empty my pockets.  There was a brutishness to their builds and expressions.  Alton had a heavy brow and an ugly look in his eye that Academy medicine couldn’t change.
    
    Dewey’s face, by contrast, had seen too much of the Academy’s attention, smoothing all of his skin to the soft texture of baby’s bottom.  I knew Dewey had been given treatment a few years back for a bad slouch, but habit had won out, and even now he was just a touch hunched over.  His hair was blond and gossamer fine.
    
    I knew where I stood with them.  I knew that Alton had been signed on because of a mean streak and a bad disciplinary record from a school very much like Mothmont, while Dewey was, along with Lacey, the only one who’d been present from the beginning.  He’d had been through lengthy and painful treatments for bad scarring he’d suffered as a child.  In their own ways, they weren’t the type to flinch, and they were good enough at what they did.  Lacey had just been good.  I imagined she’d learned not to care, rather than starting out that way.
    
    “You need anything?” Dewey asked.
    
    I shook my head.  “Had my appointment.”
    
    He looked annoyed.  “I know that.  We don’t have any reason to stick around?”
    
    I shook my head again.
    
    “Yeah,” he said.  “What’d you say to Lacey that bothered her so much?”
    
    I shrugged.
    
    “Yeah,” he said, again.  As if he was answering a question or statement.  “Okay.”
    
    “I know where to find you if I need you,” I said.
    
    “Find one of us in the office tomorrow,” he told me.  “Should check levels.”
    
    “Okay,” I said.
    
    He nodded.
    
    Easy.  No dancing around, no tricks, no posturing.
    
    Just business.
    
    Jamie was talking to the others.  His team.  From what I overheard, he was trying to convince them that no, he didn’t need to stop by their office now.  Yes, he would be there soon.  Yes, he understood that people were present now.
    
    My eye went to the book.  He was holding it with both hands, but he wasn’t holding it with a deathgrip, he wasn’t hugging it.
    
    He didn’t need help.
    
    I retreated a bit, approaching the three girls at the edge of the canopy.  Lil was talking to Mary while she fixed the bandage at Helen’s side.  Helen seemed to be taking it in stride, arching one eyebrow as she glanced back at me.
    
    The arch, much like the smiles, winks and nods, seemed to be for my benefit rather than her own.  Little touches that made me feel more nervous around her, rather than less.
    
    “…Mnemonic trick to figure out how things are laid out,” Lil said.
    
    “Trick?” Mary asked Lil.
    
    “It’s a body.  Each department has a focus.  The Tower is the head.  Record keeping.  The Rise is the shoulders, or the collarbone, the neck, supporting structures, storage, think backpack.  Then you have the Academy headquarters.  Center of everything, Claret Hall-”
    
    “The heart,” Mary said.
    
    “The rows,” Lil suggested, trailing off to give Mary the chance of offering an answer.
    
    Mary shook her head.
    
    “Ribs.  Dormitories.  I think of it as rows, ribs, bars, cage, zoo, students.  That’s how I put it together in my head, drawing the connection.  I started doing it from the beginning, but even though I know, I still sort of think that way.  I make the connection like that,” Lil said.
    
    She sounded so excited.  A kid with a chance to show her stuff.  She wasn’t a project, but she was clever in her own normal way.  Exceptionally so, it could be said.  Maybe it was because she’d been pushed to keep up with us, maybe it was because she was a rare breed.
    
    But she wasn’t one of us.  She had a family, a place to go home to.
    
    “What do you think the Hedge is?” I asked.
    
    Mary started a little at the sound of my voice.  “Hedge?  Exterior wall… skin?”
    
    I shrugged and nodded.  “Immediate care, contact with the city outside, first line of healing and prevention.”
    
    “Does that help?” Lil asked.
    
    “Help?” I cut in.
    
    “With feeling lost and overwhelmed in this place,” Lil said.
    
    “It helps a little,” Mary said, in a way that didn’t convince me in the slightest.  She moved her hands a bit to tug at her uniform top and the chains rattled.
    
    “Okay, that’s great!” Lil said, perking up, “So, after the Rows, you have other main buildings.  There’s the-”
    
    “Helen,” a voice cut through the patter of rain on the canopy roof.  It was a hard voice.
    
    Lil’s train of thought crashed right there.
    
    “Ibott,” Mary murmured.
    
    Ibott.  He was someone who had been elevated to a position in society that didn’t suit him in the slightest.  He was among the most brilliant minds at Radham, clever, not bad looking on the surface, he had the veneer of the upper class and none of the follow-through.  His hair was neatly parted, set firmly in place by something that had a way of smelling rancid at the end of the day, leaving his hair locked into hard strings that crossed one corner of his forehead.  His round eyeglasses were gold-rimmed, but so smudged I could barely see the eyes on the other side of the glass.
    
    A name that might not have been known by every household, but was known to most.
    
    “I expected you earlier,” he said, and his phrasing was civil and proper, the tone far from it.  “In the future, you come straight inside and report to me.  Do not make me come out here.”
    
    “Yes sir,” Helen said.
    
    But you’re not always here, I thought.  Is she supposed to report regardless?
    
    Ibott seemed to think so, and now Helen would.
    
    He was now close enough to speak to us without raising his voice.  I sensed Lil shrinking back and shifted my position a little, to put myself between Ibott and her.
    
    “You’re bleeding,” he observed.
    
    “Yes sir,” Helen said.
    
    “Explain.”
    
    Before she could, I spoke up, “Sir.”
    
    He ignored me.  “I want to hear it from Helen.  I certainly hope she recalls.”
    
    “Sylvester put me in harm’s way so we could capture our target,” Helen said, before I could say anything.  “It was the best way to get me to where I could be most effective.”
    
    I would have worded that better, I thought.
    
    I was barely finished the thought when Ibott struck me.  He wasn’t a strong man, but he was several times my size, and he was a man.
    
    The noise of the back of his hand connecting with my face made virtually every head present turn.
    
    “Take more care,” he instructed me.
    
    I had to blink a few times before I was able to figure out that I was on my hands and knees.  I opened my jaw yawning-wide, feeling it pop before I was able to work my mouth to form words.  “…Yes sir.”
    
    Helen offered me her hand.  I took it.
    
    “Do not help him up,” Ibott said.  “Come.”
    
    Helen let my hand drop from hers, but she didn’t move.
    
    “Good work tonight, Helen,” I murmured.
    
    She turned and followed a step behind her creator.  Jamie’s crowd and Dewey all took care to move out of the way as the pair entered the tower.
    
    Conversation didn’t resume until the door shut behind Helen.
    
    I ignored Lil’s offer for assistance in standing, and got to my own two feet.
    
    “Always good for a first impression, Ibott is,” I said, glancing at Mary.
    
    “I don’t understand.”
    
    “If he wanted to, he’d run Radham,” I said.  “He doesn’t want to, but he still has that clout.  Not what I would have wanted you to see while trying to win you over.”
    
    “You’re assuming I have someplace else to go,” Mary said.
    
    Yeah, I thought, I am.  But maybe you don’t see all the options that really lie in front of you.
    
    I saw Jamie shift his grip on his book.  Head bent a little, arms crossed over the notebook’s leather-bound cover.
    
    “Lil,” I said, without taking my eyes off him.
    
    “Lillian.”
    
    “I don’t know how to say it without sounding like I’m telling you to go away, but… if you wanted to go to your room and get a good night’s sleep, this wouldn’t be a bad time.”
    
    “That does sound like you’re trying to get rid of me.”
    
    “But?” I asked.  “Pillow, covers, your own room, peace and quiet…”
    
    “Nightmares,” she said.
    
    “Do you think you’re going to have less nightmares, if you spend more time hanging around us?” I asked.
    
    She made a face.
    
    But she flipped her hood up, picked up her bag, and headed down the long road to the middle area of the University, where the Rows radiated out around Claret Hall.
    
    “Come on,” I said.  I grabbed Mary’s chain, tugging a bit.
    
    “Don’t,” she said, suddenly tense, resisting the pull.
    
    Which a student and a stitched bodyguard took as leave to give her a push.
    
    “Cooperate,” the student called out.
    
    “It’s fine,” I said.  “Really, it’s fine.”
    
    But it didn’t feel fine.  Jamie was shrinking into himself more, glancing my way as his group led him inside.  I was caught between the two.  Couldn’t abandon Mary at this stage, but letting Jamie go ahead without giving support…
    
    “Please, Mary,” I said.
    
    Mary hesitated, then obeyed.
    
    We covered ground quickly, Mary’s chain rattling, but I had to hold the door for her, and then the stitched bodyguards and their handlers were right behind us, wanting to keep an eye on Mary, and all in all, it was clumsy and awkward, and it took some time for us to catch up with the brisk, businesslike strides.
    
    I pushed past students in lab coats to get to Jamie.
    
    He unwrapped his arms from the book, and after a moment’s pause, he handed it to me.
    
    I took it with reverent care, and held it securely in my arms.
    
    “See you,” he said.
    
    “Soon,” I replied.
    
    Griffon getting pieced back together.  Galatea in the care of her maker, who is as different from her as night from day.
    
    And the Caterpillar…
    
    I watched the caterpillar disappear down the length of the hall.
    
    Appointment was the wrong word.
    
    I rubbed the side of my face, where I knew I’d bruise, then turned to Mary.  We were as alone as we’d get, with our stitched escort.
    
    “I wanted to show you better,” I told Mary.  “I want to show you Lambsbridge.  How we have a home, how we have each other.”
    
    “You have his book,” Mary said.  “I think I get it, even if I don’t understand the details.  I’m not sure I would have believed whatever you meant to show me.”
    
    The perils of being an established liar.
    
    “I want you to be one of us,” I said.
    
    “I think I might want to be,” she replied.
    
    “That’ll have to do,” I told her.
    
    We had nine flights of stairs to climb, and when I offered to hold up the midsection of the chain to alleviate the weight of it, she didn’t resist.
    
    When we arrived in Hayle’s office, he didn’t seem to miss that detail, either.  I saw his gaze linger where my hand held the metal links.
    
    “Dog and Catcher are after Percy,” he said.  I noted how he watched Mary.  It seemed he’d been filled in on my intentions there, too.  Jamie’s work, no doubt.  Keeping everything in order, making sure the messages were passed along.
    
    Mary didn’t flinch or react.
    
    “The pursuit would have been easier if you hadn’t burned down Percy’s home,” Hayle told me.
    
    I reacted to that.  I blinked a few times, trying to organize my thoughts and work through the shoddier bits of my memory.  “I didn’t.”
    
    Hayle leaned back in his chair.  “You didn’t?”
    
    I shook my head.
    
    “Dog and Catcher say it wasn’t Percy who did it.  They would have had the scent, even with the rain.”
    
    “I don’t have an answer for you,” I told him.
    
    “I do,” Mary said, her voice soft.  “The plan was… more complex than I think you understand.”
    
    “Complex how?” Hayle asked, his pale eyebrows rising.
    
    “The children we were copied from, he had to do something with them.  He sold them, to others with ambitions in line with his,” she said, and she couldn’t maintain eye contact, staring down at the ground instead.  “It’s a group.  One he tried to keep secret from even me.  And it’s a lot bigger than you’d think.”"""

    enemy1 = """The Enemy. Arc one. Overshoot, Percy mused.  A species finds itself with no predators and an abundance of resources.  The species grows by leaps and bounds, oftentimes exponentially, and quickly reaches a point where it vastly exceeds the space and resources available.
    
    Percy held his umbrella up at an angle, pointing it against the rain that was driving down, now.  His eye fell on the Academy.  This late in the evening, it was one of the only points of light in this dark little city, walled in, with enough lights around the Hedge that the front wall was illuminated.
    
    He turned away, shifting his grip on his umbrella.  His free hand reached up to tenderly prod his own damaged face.  The moment he’d been hurt, he’d chosen to exaggerate the severity of it.  He’d trusted his Mary.
    
    His walk was brisk.  Running was a giveaway, walking was too slow.  He compromised on both fronts.  Living here, one got used to the rain, walking on slick sidewalk and road.  The Academy had wanted rain, they had devised a method to get it, algae that were now part of the water system.  Buildings at the periphery of Radham spouted out fumes that would catalyze the bacteria.
    
    When Overshoot occurred, the end result was often a devastating collapse of the system that had formed.  Populations often died en masse.
    
    The wind nearly tore his umbrella from his hand.  He had to pause to fix the arm at one side, where it had inverted, turning one side of the umbrella into a cup rather than a shield.  While he did so, he took the opportunity to glance over his shoulder, double-checking.
    
    He didn’t see anyone that shouldn’t be there.  He kept a particular eye out for children, and saw nothing.
    
    He felt both relief and disappointment.  To see Mary there would have lifted his heart and it would have made him feel safer.  To see all of the boys with Mary would have left him ecstatic.  Given him hope.
    
    Only rain and shadow in equal proportion.
    
    Radham worked so hard to portray itself as something good and proper.  He’d known that much already, spending the better part of six years at Mothmont, but he’d never been one to wander the street in the worst weather.  He’d been aware of the existence of such stitched, but he’d never seen how many stitched were active late at night, collecting trash, bodies, or simply going about on predetermined errands, especially now that he was in the shadier part of Radham.
    
    A stitched was picking through a can of trash that had been left outside of a business, moving as though drunk, too loose, prone to swaying.  When it found something, a broken clock, a child’s toy, a pair of scissors, it fumbled to fold back a waterproof cloth that had been draped over a crate, placed the item inside, and then replaced the cloth.
    
    Percy wanted to help it.  To give it an hour of his time, or find its owner and tell them how to maintain it better.  Some individuals were prone to complaining about how their relatives, friends and neighbors were collected before they ever touched a coffin, or dug up at the first opportunity by grave robbers looking to make some coin by selling to would-be-students.  Oh, but if they knew that stitched were sometimes used like this, ordered to go through garbage for anything that might be of value, taking the materials to a location where the valuables could be sorted out and sold?
    
    A stitched wasn’t easy to make, but the attempted and ultimately partial revival of the dead had been one of Wollstone’s first projects, and had consequently been one of the most detailed in Wollstone’s literature.  All one had to do was obtain the materials that the Academy controlled and follow the documentation to the letter.
    
    The materials were inexpensive, the end product lasted years, longer if kept dry and maintained at the right temperature, which this poor thing wasn’t.
    
    He appreciated few things more than good work.  A craftsman with care regarding their trade.  This wasn’t that kind of good work.
    
    The creator no doubt had access to a great many bodies, and thought it easier to go to a third-rate Academy graduate and have another made, than to work to keep this one functioning.
    
    Flesh was cheap.  Dead flesh cheaper.
    
    The stitched turned its head, looking in Percy’s direction.  The eyes were nearly gone, the pupils and irises clouded with milky white.
    
    It wasn’t, however, looking at Percy himself.
    
    He followed the gaze of the stitched creature, and he saw two figures in the rain.
    
    The first and most obvious was a monster.  Four-legged, It stood tall enough that if it walked against a building, its shoulder would brush the upper end of a doorframe, but it was narrow enough that it could fit through the doorway itself, if it ducked its head down.  It had parts of a human face, writ large, the features largely concealed by long black hair.  Here and there, where flesh wasn’t sufficient, large amounts of metal had been set in place, fixed to flesh and bone.  Light from a streetlamp reflected green in its eyes.
    
    The other figure was a man, wearing a wide-brimmed hat and a long jacket. The light from the streetlamp reflected green in his eyes as well.  He carried a stick with a collar fixed to one end, ready to snap shut once touched to the throat, a bear trap without the teeth.  Sometimes it had spikes, Percy knew, but no.
    
    No, Dog and Catcher wanted him alive.  To question.  To take his work, repurpose it.  It was only a matter of time.  The only reason they hadn’t noticed him was that they were distracted by something else.  It seemed Catcher was saying something, though the collar of his jacket was high enough to hide his mouth.
    
    Dog nodded, and the sound he made in reply was deep and loud enough to be almost audible.  Speaking was impossible for the thing, given the mangled metal wreck that was his lower jaw.
    
    How could Percy even describe the feeling that came over him, then?  The dread, the misery.  He imagined the feeling being very much like what he might experience if confronted by the family of the children he had replaced with his own.  If he had been cut down mid-stride, before accomplishing his goals.
    
    As if a weight had been dropped on him from high above, smashing all he was to pieces, while leaving his body intact.
    
    But dread didn’t help him.  He circled the garbage-scrounger and used the creature’s bulk and smell to hide him from sight and nose.
    
    With a note of regret, he folded up his umbrella, subjecting himself to the rain.  Bone handle, properly waterproof.  Too large to go in the crate, too obvious a thing to be carrying.
    
    “I hope your master rewards you by tending to you,” Percy murmured.  “So please forgive me for this.”
    
    He pulled the waterproof cloth away from the top of the crate, where it protected the contents, threw it over his head and shoulders, then hefted the crate.  He contemplated kicking off his boots, but decided against it.
    
    Visually, it would mask him from their view.  But their eyes were the least of his problems.
    
    They could see better than him, they could track scents as well as any bloodhound, they could hear, as rumor went, a leaf settling on the ground, and they had the wits to use that information.
    
    If they were this close, they had his scent, and if they had his scent, that mancatcher was as good as around his neck.
    
    A sound behind him almost made him startle, but jumping or jerking could well be a giveaway.
    
    Dog disappeared into an alley, traveling parallel to him.
    
    Percy stumbled forward, box in hand, his thoughts a dull roar.  There were no good options.  Even if Mary or Clyde were here, the best they could hope to accomplish would be buying time.  If the stars aligned right, perhaps they could put down Catcher.
    
    But victory wouldn’t happen.  Escape was out of the question.
    
    Dog revealed himself by making a clatter, three floors above the ground, walking on a nearby rooftop.  With each step, shingles broke free and skidded down the roof to sail toward the ground below.
    
    There were only three building lots between Percy and the war machine.  It had stopped at the end of one rooftop, and now strained, head raised, broad, bat-like nostrils flaring.
    
    Dog almost casually leaped from rooftop to road.  Metal braces in and around the legs locked, sprung, and slammed into new configurations, absorbing some of the impact.  Muscle and mass handled the remainder.
    
    Now that Dog was closer, Percy could see how tubes ran up and around the legs, disappearing into metal-framed slits in the side.  Two tubes carried blood, while the third carried what might have been water.
    
    Dog was an ugly piece of work, which was odd, considering that Dog was one of the best known of the Academy’s ‘secret’ projects.  There were experiments that were done with care, thought through from the beginning.  This was not that.  It was a project that had been started, one largely doomed to failure.  When structural integrity had failed, crude metal engineering had been set in place.  When circulation was poor, things were rerouted, tubes set in place to serve where veins and arteries couldn’t, sometimes outside the body.
    
    Little doubt there were other problems.  The Academy was probably happy that was the case.  A Dog couldn’t run if it needed regular drainage or a specialized diet.
    
    The Academy had overshot.  In this case it had made effective use of that fact.
    
    Dog turned his head, staring at Percy with those eyes that caught the light, the eyelids moved, providing a smile the mouth couldn’t.
    
    It was fruitless to resist, or even try to run, but it galled Percy to know that it would be this that ended him.  He turned and prepared to go, when he saw Catcher drawing near.
    
    The man toyed with the mancatcher, the collar on a stick.  The collar section of the tool spun, whirling so fast it was a blur in the gloom, sending off a spray of water droplets.
    
    Catcher’s voice was rough-edged, a man who had smoked or was speaking through a bad cold.  “You changed coaches twice, walked through deep puddles.  Even wore a maggot-ridden blanket.”
    
    Maggots?
    
    Percy pulled at the piece of cloth he’d put over his head, but it still took a second for his eyes to adjust.  He saw the maggots wriggling, and flinched, casting the cloth away.
    
    His scalp crawled, now, his neck and face.  Once he felt it, every drop of rain he couldn’t verify with his eyes was potentially a maggot, vermin, filth.
    
    Catcher shifted his grip on the mancatcher, and Percy stumbled back, only to find that Dog was behind him, mouth open, teeth ready to bite.
    
    But he still held the crate.  Using it for Dog would be useless, but-
    
    Catcher thrusted, aiming for Percy’s throat, and Percy raised the box, the opening facing the weapon.
    
    The crate was torn from his hands, thrown a distance away by a violent swing of the pole.
    
    Too strong.  Catcher alone would have been enough, but there were two of them.
    
    Wollstone’s work had caught hold of him from an early age.  It had defined his life.  Now it would, in a roundabout way, end it.
    
    He thought of his creations.  Of Clyde, and of Mary.
    
    In the same moment he realized his own mortality, he knew his legacy was gone.
    
    He felt a flare of anger.
    
    Percy nurtured the feeling, used it to find courage, and reached into his jacket for his pistol.
    
    Catcher seized his wrist, then stopped, glancing down.
    
    “That was…” Catcher asked, trailing off.  His head turned.
    
    Dog growled, then darted off in the same direction.
    
    A fog was rising around them.
    
    No, it was a gas.  Pea-soup thick, the cloud rose steadily despite the downpour.
    
    Catcher started using his grip on Percy’s wrist to pull, tugging him away from the swelling cloud.  Percy used his other hand to reach across his front for the gun, only to have Catcher move the mancatcher to prod his arm.
    
    The collar, slightly too wide around for Percy’s upper arm, slammed shut.  The hole was large enough that he could have pulled his arm free if he’d been given the chance, but he wasn’t.  The weapon rotated, the edges digging into his arm, and the implicit promise was that trying to pull free despite the pressure might see skin scraped away by the weapon’s edges.
    
    Out of the same flame of anger that had driven him to reach for the gun, Percy found himself fighting Catcher.  His opponent was strong enough to lift him, but Percy hauled himself downward, made every step a difficult one with one of his feet braced against Catcher’s thigh.  He strained to move toward the gas that had alarmed these two abominations so very much.
    
    It was stupid, reckless, and it was ugly, everything Percy had worked against.  Every step of the way, he’d fought against the current, and every step of the way, he’d done things with care.  Not all of it was things he could be proud of, but he’d weighed his options, and had never done a thing he felt he could later regret, in the grand scheme of it all.
    
    Even his dealings with the children.
    
    This, he instinctively felt, was something he might very well regret more than anything else, even if it only left him minutes or seconds more of life.
    
    In the end, he succeeded.  His head moved too far back, and the gas washed over his face.
    
    In an instant, he was blind, seeing through a veil.  Foul, acrid tastes and smells flooded his nose and mouth.
    
    His struggles with Catcher continued, less effective now that he was blinded.
    
    When he was dropped, he kicked and flailed into the blurry darkness.
    
    When a hand pressed around his mouth, he struck out, hit flesh.  He struck again, and felt long hair.
    
    His hand moved more gently through the hair, with a degree of caution this time, with care.
    
    Mary?
    
    He opened his mouth to ask, but whatever it was that had filled it with foul taste, it was like a thick flour, caking his tongue and inner cheeks, making them stick to his teeth.  His lips bound together, cracking and bleeding as he pulled them apart.
    
    The hand over his mouth moved, until only one finger pressed against his lips.
    
    The fingers seized his bleeding lower lip and tugged.  Leading him like a mutt on a leash, and he knew it wasn’t his Mary.
    
    He obeyed all the same.
    
    A few staggering footsteps, not knowing where he was going.  A ruckus occurred behind them.
    
    The hand took his wrist, instead, and he followed, for what seemed like an interminably long time, but was likely only a handful of minutes.
    
    The hand freed his wrist.
    
    Another minute passed.  He started to feel his heartbeat pick up.  Fear, humiliation, worry.  He was dirty, covered in maggots, bloody, and except for his silent companion, he was alone.
    
    He heard a woman’s sigh, not one of exasperation, but relief.
    
    “It’s water,” she said, and her voice was muffled.  “Right in front of you.  Rinse your face, try to get your nose and ears as well, or you won’t see or hear very well for a long time.”
    
    He obeyed, fumbling until he found the rain barrel.  He made use of the water, rubbing at his eyes, only to pull away long strings of goop.  It snapped before he could get much of it.  He pulled away as much as he could, checked his vision, and still found it blurry.  His second attempt suggested that absolutely none of it had dissipated.
    
    “It uses the mucus membranes,” she explained.  “Binds to to the mucus itself.  You’re going to be congested, and you’ll be pulling gobbets of the stuff from your nose and mouth for a long time.  Give it an hour or two and it’ll be more solid.  The rinse is meant to clear things up.”
    
    “How long?” he managed.  He still felt as though his tongue was coated in wax.  He blinked and made out a raven-haired beauty in a close-fitting jacket.
    
    “Long enough you might worry I lied to you and that permanent damage was done.  Wash with regularity, it will get better.”
    
    He looked back over his shoulder.
    
    “They’re gone,” she reassured him.  “It affected them worse than it affected you.  They still put up a fight, which I didn’t expect.  I had three stitched with me, and Catcher took them to pieces.  The Academy will diagnose the problem and mend those two within a day, and then they’ll devise a means to prevent it, but…”
    
    “But you saved me?” Percy asked.
    
    He could make out enough of her face to see a smile.
    
    “You saved me, and you sacrificed three stitched and a trump card to do it.  You’re with them.”
    
    “Yes.”
    
    For the first time since the anonymous note had informed him the Academy was coming for him, he felt himself relax a touch.
    
    He dunked his face again, then shook it violently in the water, side to side, splashing, trying to free up any of the substance that might be clinging.
    
    When he stood straight, he put his hands to his hair and then combed it with his fingers.
    
    His vision was still only half of what it had been.
    
    “Come,” she said, smiling.
    
    The destination, as it turned out, was a nondescript store with an old cowboy’s hat over the door.
    
    “Ever been to a place like this?” his companion asked, ascending the stairs ahead of him.   She shot him a light smile over one shoulder.
    
    “I, ah, never have, believe it or not.”
    
    “I believe you,” she said.  “You’re more the type to find someone of that calling and invite her to your place.”
    
    She knew him that well?
    
    “During daytime, no less,” she said.
    
    Ah.  “You’ve been watching me that well, then.”
    
    “The man that walks around your home outside of the school hours, pulling the cart?  Ours.”
    
    “I see.”
    
    They’d reached the top of the stairs, two floors up, and reached a door with another cowboy’s hat above it.  Rather than open it, his companion turned around, then wiped at his face, touching his hair.
    
    His blood still pumping and face already hot from the humiliation of his futile struggle against Catcher, just after hearing intimate topics raised so readily, he felt more than a little flustered.
    
    From the smile on her face, she seemed to know it.  Perhaps she had been watching him even more carefully than he’d known.  Enough to know he liked to be in control, to steer things, and she was denying him that chance.
    
    Before he could ask a question, she opened the door.
    
    The walls were draped with red velvet or silk or something very close to it, traced with gold.  The pillars had branches reaching up and around them, and one branch had a small bird on it.  The light was electrical, cast through red glass.
    
    Scattered around the room, in a very haphazard fashion, there were eight or nine people in chairs, on couches, or standing.
    
    “Cynthia,” an old man greeted her.  “And Mr. Percy.”
    
    “Catcher and Dog were there.  I used my blinding powder, they’ll know what it is for next time.  Louis is going to tell you I didn’t let him set the Academy’s Dog on fire, but it seemed too risky.  Every time we made a sound, Catcher would charge at us.  I let the stitched make all the sounds they wanted, and we left.  It was the best option, Catcher wasn’t slowing down.”
    
    “He doesn’t, that is his design,” the old man said.  Percy blinked to try and get a better view.  Changing his tone, the old man spoke again, “You did well.”
    
    Talking to me.
    
    “I failed.  My creations are dead.”
    
    “Mmm, I’m afraid so,” the old man said.  “We confirmed for ourselves.  Three boys and a girl, killed by the Academy’s set.”
    
    Percy felt a wrench in his chest.  He managed to keep his expression calm.
    
    It was good.  The deliberate act of control helped to center him.  He felt more like himself.
    
    “What were you doing?” a woman asked.  She was surrounded by cages.  The shapes within suggested birds.
    
    Percy opened his mouth to answer, then shut it.
    
    “You won’t say?” Cynthia asked, and her tone was teasing.
    
    “You brought me here for a reason.”
    
    “We did,” the old man said.
    
    Percy chose his words carefully.  “I feel as though I’m being judged.”
    
    “We all are, always,” the woman with the birds said.  “Are you weak, strong, useful, a fitting romantic partner, a friend, an enemy?”
    
    “I’ll reword.  I’m on trial.”
    
    “No,” the old man said.  “Wrong word, that.”
    
    “It matters, what I say, how I say it.  And don’t say it always matters.  You know what I mean.”
    
    “Yes,” the old man said.  “I know.  Tell us, what were you doing?”
    
    Percy remained silent, considering.
    
    When Cynthia spoke, her voice was soft, but it wasn’t uncertain in the least.  “There is nothing you can say that is worse than saying nothing at all.”
    
    Percy didn’t speak right away, but he did make the decision to speak.  “I’m not proud.  I started out wanting to prove myself to them.  I had an idea, I wanted to see it through, and show them that they were wrong to refuse it.”
    
    “Your clones.”
    
    “Yes,” Percy said.
    
    “Your work seemed impeccable, considering your limited access to Academy resources.  They protect their texts and charts with a dangerous passion.  It’s half of what Dog and Catcher do, rounding up those who have or copy the books.  Every academy has projects that do, dressing them up as patriots and protectors of the Crown.”
    
    “There were teachers who brought sections of the texts to the school.  I caught glimpses, and I held phrases and numbers in my head until I could write them down, sometimes hours later.”
    
    “Impressive,” a man in the corner said.  “Why?  You started out wanting to prove yourself to the Academy, then you started killings.  To hurt Mothmont, and to hurt the Academy too?”
    
    “To become Headmaster.  Once I could dictate policy, I planned to mass produce.”
    
    “Mass produce clones?”
    
    Percy managed a smile with his cracked, gummed-up lips.  “Imagine, please, a new method of warfare.  One where a single man or clone can infiltrate, they can target children, replace them, the clones would educate their new peers in how to act like children, and slowly but silently capture an entire generation.  One command or order, all in one night, and an entire city would be brought to its knees.”
    
    “I do like this sort of imagining,” the old man said.  “The Academy likes its weapons, as you saw with it’s pet Dog.”
    
    “The Academy didn’t like my weapon.  Not because of what it was, but because they had a vision in mind, a group of children working together.  My idea was too slow for Hayle.”
    
    “You wanted to make it work.  The lives of children meant nothing to you, you sold them without a care as to what we were using them for?”
    
    Is it a trial after all?
    
    “The lives of my children mean something to me.”
    
    “Do you want revenge for them, Percy?”
    
    “Yes.”
    
    “Then you’ll have it.  You’ll carry out your plan.”
    
    “They know how I operate.  They’ll be checking, to be safe.”
    
    “Let them waste their time, then.  There are other routes.”
    
    Percy narrowed his eyes, felt the film in them, and rubbed at one with the knuckle of his thumb.  “Other routes?”
    
    In answer, Cynthia reached up and tapped one of the red lights.
    
    Percy nodded in realization.
    
    “We’ll be working together,” she said.  “To create beautiful pieces of work.”
    
    “And you’ll be doing it with more resources,” the bird woman said.
    
    “While staying well out of sight,” the old man said, with a little more emphasis.  “I’m sure you understand.”
    
    Percy nodded slowly, taking it all in.  He allowed himself a smile.
    
    “I’m sure it won’t take much convincing to have you act against the Academy?” the old man asked.
    
    Percy mused for a moment.  “Whenever I think of the Academy, I think of the concept of the Overshoot.  You’re familiar with it, I presume?“
    
    “I was a professor,” the old man said, “you can trust I am.”
    
    Percy smiled a little.  “They’re treading dangerous ground.  Verging on collapse.  Hayle sees it too, but he thinks he can make minds brilliant enough to solve the problem.  I think he’s only going to wind up contributing to it.  No, I most definitely don’t have a problem acting against them.”
    
    The demeanor of the others in the room told him he’d passed his trial.
    
    “Can I wash my face?” he asked, as others settled in, and the din of conversatino rose.  “Again?”
    
    “This way,” Cynthia said.  “You have a room.”
    
    She led him to his quarters.  His eyes went as wide as the blinding film let them.
    
    A complete set of Academy texts.  Large vats, sufficient to house a person.
    
    “The basin is this way,” Cynthia said.  “You have an bathroom adjunct.”
    
    He almost didn’t hear her.  His finger traced the closest vat.
    
    He would create life, play the littlest of gods.
    
    Clones, he thought.  From Ancient Greek Klon-.  Meaning Twig.
    
    He smiled at the thought, before going to wash his face."""
